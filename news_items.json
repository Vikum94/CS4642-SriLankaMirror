{"topic": "OHCHR registers case number 500 for Sri Lanka", "full_news": "This example is taken from one of the cases in which the Committee on Enforced Disappearances activated its Urgent Action mechanism: a process which elevates an enforced disappearance from the local, individual level up to a matter between a UN committee of human rights experts, and the highest authorities of the country where the disappearance occurred. This week, the Committee reached the grim milestone of 500 cases registered under this procedure. \u201cEach Urgent action represents a disappeared person whose family, relatives and friends are suffering every minute of their life by having no idea as to that person\u2019s fate and whereabouts,\u201d said Suela Janina, Chair of the Committee. The number of Urgent Actions has been increasing steadily since the Convention entered into force in 2010. On a practical level, when the Committee receives information about an enforced disappearance, it contacts the country concerned and the relatives of the victim or their representatives, Ms. Janina continued. \u201cWhen a person is reported to have fallen victim to enforced disappearance, immediate intervention is key\u201d, said Rainer Huhle, vice-president of the Committee. \u201cThere is no valid justification for asking relatives of a disappeared person to wait 24, 48 or 72 hours before taking action\u201d, he emphasized. This procedure, commonly called \u201curgent action\u201d is one of the most innovative features of the Convention on enforced disappearance. The exchanges between the Committee, the State party and the person who requested the activation of the urgent action procedure go on until the disappeared person is located. \u201cThese exchanges are at the core of the procedure. The Committee can also ask the State party to adopt measures to protect the persons who are in danger because of their link with the disappeared person, or because of the actions they have taken to search for him or her,\u201d said Ms. Janina. The Committee\u2019s aim, she explained, is to help all involved, and to provide guidance to States parties for them to abide by their obligations under the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Among those obligations is the demand that enforced disappearances do not happen again.

The crisis has intensified after Thilak Silva, the chairman of the Sugathadasa Stadium had refused to accept the responsibility of this new synthetic track. He had stated he would take measures on this regard only if the engineers at the sports ministry and the Sugathadasa stadium would take responsibility. The track was unveiled for the South Asian Junior Athletics meet, but was closed down later, citing renovations. However, it is learnt that the track remains open for training. However, plans have been hatched to task the same company with the laying of synthetic tracks at the Matale and Rathnapura stadiums, internal sources from the ministry say. The budget for the track laying at the Matale stadium was tabled at the recent Cabinet meeting. According to the Tender contracted signed to lay the most recent track at Sugathadasa, (which took place during the tenure of Dayasiri Jayasekera as sports minister) the new track had come with a guarantee for several years and an insurance coverage. Before that, during the tenure of Mahindananda Aluthgamage, a synthetic track was laid at a cost of nearly Rs. 200 million. However, the track could be used for barely an year due to being substandard.

Xi, who chaired the SCO annual summit Sunday, attributed the SCO's strength to the Shanghai Spirit, which champions mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations and pursuit of common development. Sultan Mehmood Hali, head of Pakistan-China Media Forum and a senior defense and political analyst, echoed Xi's remarks, saying that the Shanghai Spirit is the \"driving force\" and \"guiding force\" for the 17-year-old organization. \"It has gelled the first six countries and now eight countries together to have a common destiny and transcend the differences with each other and develop into a system of cooperation which requires mutual trust, mutual respect and shared values,\" Hali said. At a roundtable meeting, Xi praised the SCO as \"a new model for regional cooperation,\" which was well received by experts. \"Within the framework of the SCO, multiple regional problems can be solved, such as security and strategic stability, as well as economic integration,\" said Boris Volkhonsky, head of the Asia and Pacific Rim Center of the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies. \"Today, with the participation of the leading economies of Eurasia, the SCO has become an integral core,\" said Volkhonsky. The SCO was established in 2001 by China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. With two new members, it now accounts for nearly half of the world's population and over 20 percent of the global economy. At the summit, Xi urged related parties to \"work closely to build an SCO community with a shared future\" and \"move toward a new type of international relations.\" \"We should reject self-centered, short-sighted and closed-door policies,\" Xi said. \"Equality, mutual learning, dialogue and inclusiveness between cultures should be championed.\" Konstantin Garibov, analyst for Russia's Sputnik News Agency, said Xi's speech showed that China is willing to \"help ensure that the Eurasian space becomes a model of a new type of international relations based on a stable world, universal security, common prosperity, openness and inclusiveness.\" Experts also highlighted Xi's emphasis on people-to-people exchanges, saying that it will lead to a win-win situation. MD Nalapat, director of the Department of Geopolitics at Manipal University in India, said China has demonstrated through the SCO that there is a better solution than a military one. \"A better solution is to have a calm solution involving people-to-people contact, involving soft power and involving conciliation,\" he said. \"I think frankly that is the Chinese way, the 'win-win' situation.\" Hali, the Pakistani analyst, believes the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China can promote such exchanges. It's a platform in which \"you reach out to everyone, you share each other's progress and you benefit from each other,\" he said.

Sri Lanka's economic risk trend has been revised to stable from negative. \"Aggressive growth in the past has led to rising economic imbalances, but we do not expect an escalation,\" S&P Global Ratings said in a statement. Sri Lanka's banking non-performing loans could deteriorate as fallout of aggressive growth of the last few years followed by drought in 2016 and floods in 2017,\" it said. However, the rise in non-performing loans is not expected to be sharp and industry risks will be stable as Sri Lanka's growth prospects are seen improving despite a recent weakening of banks' funding profile. The banking regulator Central Bank's role is seen improving although weaker than peers. Excerpts of Standard and Poor's statement are as follows: \"We classify the banking sector of Sri Lanka in group '8' under our Banking Industry Country Risk Assessment (BICRA). \"Our bank criteria use our BICRA economic risk and industry risk scores to determine a bank's anchor, the starting point in assigning an issuer credit rating. The anchor for banks operating only in Sri Lanka is 'bb-'. \"In our view, the Sri Lankan banking sector's resilience is weak and is affected by the country's low income levels. Credit risk is high, in our opinion, given relaxed lending and underwriting standards as well as evolving risk management practices. \"We have revised Sri Lanka's economic risk trend to stable from negative. We believe that aggressive growth in the past has led to a rise in economic imbalances, but we do not expect further escalation in economic imbalances. While we expect loan growth to remain higher than nominal GDP growth, the gap has narrowed, reducing risks of a further build-up of economic imbalances. Moreover, the sovereign external position continues to stabilize. \"Sri Lankan banks' funding profiles benefit from a good level of stable core customer deposits. In addition, we believe the large number of banks relative to the economy's size has not led to any significant instability in the competitive environment. However, the dominance of government-owned banks and directed lending to the agricultural sector somewhat distort the competitive environment, in our view. \"In our opinion, the Sri Lankan central bank's regulation and supervision have strengthened over the years, although they remain weaker than that of international peers. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is taking several measures that we believe will help strengthen capital positions of banks' and non-banks in the next few years. The measures would benefit the banking system in the longer term by providing good capital buffers to absorb unexpected losses. Nevertheless, most of the banks will have to step up capital (including hybrid) issuances in 2018. \"The banking system's nonperforming loans (NPLs) could continue to deteriorate in 2018. This is a fallout of banks' aggressive growth in the past few years and Sri Lanka's drought in 2016 and flooding in 2017, which disturbed the agriculture sector and agro-based industrial activity. However, the NPL rise is unlikely to be sharp because we continue to expect Sri Lanka's growth prospects to be favorable. \"We assess the trend for industry risk as stable. We expect Sri Lankan banks to largely use deposits to meet their funding needs, despite a recent weakening in the banking industry's funding profile. We believe that larger banks with strong franchises will continue to dominate the sector\".

According to submissions made in court, Chulananda Perera has imposed the penalty on July 14, 2017. One-time Batticaloa \u00a0Government Agent, \u00a0Charles succeeded Perera on Sept. 26, 2017. Perera received transfer to the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS) pool. The Attorney General\u2019s Department made recent submissions to the Court of Appeal in respect of the case filed by attorney-at-law and Solicitor (UK) Nagananda Kodituwakku on behalf of Customs Director M. Dayaparam against local agent for BMW, Prestige Automobile Pvt. Ltd. Kodituwakku told The Island that the Customs decision to investigate the import of 1,675 BMWs afresh would give the country new hope. Following representations made by Nagananda Kodituwakku to the Customs, Mrs. Charles has sought relevant information from German Customs to facilitate the inquiry. Koditiwakku said that he sought the Customs intervention in the wake of German authorities assuring their support in the event Director General Customs made the request. Charles has requested for original invoices from BMW AG of Germany to probe what Kodituwakku, one-time head of the Customs revenue Task Force called the biggest-ever single revenue fraud in the history of the Customs. According Kodituwakku, the German Customs in a letter dated Oct. 24, 2017 assured him of their readiness to support Sri Lankan inquiry in case they received formal request from the relevant authority. Senior officer Dayaparam, who detected the fraud explained to Kodituwakku how a set of falsified invoices had been presented to the Customs instead of the original documents from Germany. The new Customs Chief has re-opened investigations after examining the circumstances leading to the fraud, Koditiwakku said. Responding to a query, Kodituwakku pointed out that vehicles worth more than 25,000 USD couldn\u2019t be exempted from taxes. But, tax exemptions had been received for BMWs worth over USD 30,000 each by furnishing fictitious invoices which placed the value well under USD 25,000. Kodituwakku said that the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) was briefed of alleged fraud. The CIABOC was continuing the case, the lawyer said. Responding to a query, Kodituwakku said that the importer had moved court against the former Customs Director General\u2019s directive to impose penalty of Rs 100,000 on each BMW. Kodituwakku said that now that German Customs had agreed to cooperate with Sri Lanka, Germany would inquire into the circumstances under which procedures were manipulated. The attorney-at-law said that a separate inquiry was needed to identify the illegal trade in duty free vehicle permits issued to members of parliament and various other professionals. Kodituwakku said that a joint Sri Lanka-German investigation was required to determine the involvement of various persons in this racket.

{"topic": "100 Women: The modern face of the 'DIY abortion'", "full_news": "By buying pills online and sharing medical advice through WhatsApp groups, women are increasingly turning to technology to sidestep legal barriers to abortion. This is the modern face of the so-called \"DIY abortion\". Countries with the strictest laws, where abortion is allowed only to save a woman's life or banned altogether, have over 10 times higher search interest in abortion pill Misoprostol compared to countries with no restrictions, BBC analysis shows. There are two main methods of inducing abortion; surgical and medical. A medical abortion typically involves taking a combination of pills, Misoprostol and Mifeprostone, to induce a miscarriage. Misoprostol can also go by brand names like Cytotec. While women in countries such as the UK will be prescribed this combination by a doctor, women searching for and purchasing the pills online in countries where access to abortion is restricted are often breaking the law, risking severe punishments. Ghana and Nigeria are the two countries with the highest search interest in Misoprostol, according to the Google data. Ghana only allows abortions in cases of rape, incest, foetal impairment or to preserve a woman's mental health. Nigeria is stricter still: abortion is only allowed in situations where a woman's life is in danger. Of the 25 countries with highest search interest in Misoprostol, 11 are in Africa and 14 in Latin America. All but two - Zambia and Mozambique - either ban abortions altogether or allow them only to save a woman's life or health. The BBC recently reported on a WhatsApp group, operating in Brazil, helping women get hold of the pills and offering them advice during the procedure. Juliana (not her real name) was one of the women who sought the WhatsApp group's help. \"I did the procedure alone at my house and reported the time I was going to start to the WhatsApp group,\" says the 28-year-old. \"What I thought was really nice, is how the other women in the group help each other, sharing information, and discussing doubts and fears. This strengthened me, in a way. \"It's always good to know that you're not alone. The group was very important to me, for me to feel safe.\" Analysing Google data doesn't just show the countries where search interest is highest. It can also show how often exact phrases are searched about a topic. \"Abortion pills\" is a top search phrase on abortion in all the countries analysed by the BBC. \"How to abort\" is the most commonly asked question in more than two-thirds of countries. \"How to use Misoprostol\", \"Misoprostol price\", \"buy Misoprostol\" and \"Misoprostol dosage\" feature among the most common searches around abortion. Alongside abortion pills, women are also turning to their search engines to source alternative methods to self-induce abortions. Herbs like parsley, cinnamon, vitamin C, aspirin and abortion teas (herbal concoctions) all came up as top searched methods. In half of the countries we looked at \"home remedies for abortion\" was a top search related to abortion. One study, which looked at the use of abortion teas in sub-Saharan Africa, found that while some plants did affect the uterus, there were many drawbacks to this traditional method. Along with a lack of data around safety, the study suggested it was hard for practitioners to control dosage and side-effects. None of the \"home remedies\" listed above are considered safe abortion methods by the World Health Organisation. Worldwide, about 25 million unsafe abortions take place each year, according to the World Health Organisation, accounting for 45% of all abortions. These 25 million unsafe abortions are categorised even further. Although Misoprostol is normally considered a safe method of abortion when administered by a medical professional, when it is used by an untrained person it poses risks. When it is administered by an untrained person, the World Health Organisation classes it as \"less safe\" and says this accounts for almost one-third (31%) of the total number of abortions, both safe and unsafe. \"Even when the quality of the drugs is perfect and you follow the protocol to the letter, there is still a failure rate,\" says Dhammika Perera, the global medical director at Marie Stopes International. When a woman buys the pills online, or is provided them by an untrained person, it increases the chances of a failed abortion, he says. These women are also less likely to go for post-abortion care if something goes wrong. \"Stigma, cost, geographical access can all make women hesitate and that puts them at risk,\" Mr Perera says. \"It's slow progress, but that there is progress, is unquestionable. \"Globally some backward steps have been taken, in the US for example, but I remain hopeful.\" About 14% of all abortions were \"least safe\", which means they were provided by untrained persons using dangerous methods, such as the introduction of foreign objects and use of herbal concoctions. Complications such as infection and incomplete abortion can arise from these methods. When an abortion is incomplete, medical professionals may either advise further medication, or a surgical option, depending on the situation. At least 22,800 women die each year from complications of unsafe abortion, the Guttmacher Institute reports.

Wijewardena, speaking to BBC Sinhala Service, predicted that the Rupee could depreciate to between Rs. 160 and Rs. 165 by the end of this year. Now, That situation is likely sooner. Explaining the reasons, Dr. Wijewardena said the country thus had to pay for the dissimilar economic policies. It is important the government, having two key affiliates, follows a single economic policy. The UNP is having a V 2025, while the National Economic Council headed by the president has launched a different economic policy, he noted. However, nobody knows if the two policies match each other or not, he said. The ex-deputy governor went onto say that the structural weaknesses in the economy were resulting in the continuous depreciation of the Rupee. From 2008 onward, instead of focusing on the exports sector, policies were formulated to build an indigenous economy, he said. Exports would have increased in dollars terms, but taken as a ratio of the GDP, it declined from 22 per cent to around 12 pc by 2014-15. The export income (11 billion USD) is now on the decline, while import expenditure has gone up steeply to around 20 billion USD. This year, the trade deficit could be estimated at around 10 billion USD, said Dr. Wijewardena. That gap has to be bridged mainly from foreign remittances by expatriate workers, but that income fluctuates, he noted. It would be dangerous for the Central Bank to release its reserves, comprising mainly of foreign borrowings, in order to meet that requirement, he warned. Therefore, it should get involved in the market very carefully and wisely, making the Rupee to stabilize. But, that mediation did not happen last week, and the Rupee depreciated, he said. The remedial measures he recommends are a change in economic policies for quick results, identifying the export segments that needs to be improved in the next 18 months and identifying the services segments that needs to be improved in the next 24 months.", "intro": "The Sri Lankan Rupee yesterday (07) had its worst ever depreciation against the US dollar, falling to Rs. 160 per dollar.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/8941-depreciation-of-the-rupee-due-to-dissimilar-economic-policies"},

Despite the absence of formal data, these issues are all too familiar to women and girls, the survey confirms. \u201cI have witnessed, on multiple occasions, male passengers inappropriately touching and leaning on small girls,\u201d said Varuni Manel*, a 23-year-old study participant. \u201cBus conductors also unnecessarily touch small children when getting on to the bus.\u201d The study also shines a light on the far-reaching effects this harassment has on the lives of women and girls, from their educations and livelihoods to their place of residence and personal relationships. Humiliated and afraid Initiated in 2015, the study included 2,500 individuals between the ages of 15 and 35. Information was gathered through interviews, questionnaires and focus groups. Every administrative district in all of Sri Lanka\u2019s nine provinces was represented. Women reported experiencing a wide range of mistreatment on public transport, including leering, verbal abuse and unwelcome advances, but the majority of harassment was physical. Seventy-four per cent of women and girls reported they had been deliberately touched. Sixty per cent reported their personal space had been invaded, and 52 per cent said the offender\u2019s genitals were rubbed against their bodies. Ninety-seven per cent said the perpetrators were male. Women in the survey described feeling humiliated and afraid. \u201cOnce when I was travelling by bus to go to class, a boy around 15 years old was sitting next to me. He ejaculated on my dress before getting off the bus,\u201d said Rani Kumari*, 18. \u201cThere was nothing I could do. I felt helpless, and I didn\u2019t speak to anyone about it.\u201d Women in Sri Lanka \u2013 especially low-income women \u2013 rely heavily on public transport. Half of female study participants said they use it to go to work, and 28 per cent said it was how they travelled to pursue their educations. There is evidence that harassment and the threat of harassment are limiting women\u2019s mobility, participation in public life and overall well-being. A quarter of survey participants said harassment occurred monthly. About 12 per cent said it occurred daily. In some cases, women reported it was so frequent, and alternative modes of travel so scarce, that they moved residence to escape. Forty-four per cent of women said that harassment on public transport affected their personal lives. Twenty-nine per cent said it had an impact on their school performance, and 37 per cent said it negatively affected their work performance. \u201cAs a nurse I have to work late nights,\u201d Gayanthi Thilini*, 31, said in a focus group. \u201cOn one occasion, after leaving work exhausted, I got onto a bus and noticed a male passenger seated behind me. He was well-dressed and in his mid-40s. He started unnecessarily touching me, and as I objected, he told me that I should travel in a private vehicle.\u201d These abuses \u2013 and the culture of inequality they spring from \u2013 may be contributing to women\u2019s economic marginalization. According to the Census on Population and Housing, labour force participation among women fell from over 39 per cent in 2006 to less than 35 per cent in 2014. The study has started a conversation, not only on safety in public transport but also on the wider issues of violence, women\u2019s rights and gender equality. UNFPA is working with government officials to raise awareness of these matters, and to spread word about a hotline women can call to report abuses. They are also working towards gathering more data on gender discrimination and violence, in order to inform policies that better uphold the rights of women. \"The study is important as it highlights the grave gender discriminations that persist towards women and girls,\u201d said Sharika Cooray, a UNFPA gender analyst in Sri Lanka.

The President Counsel pointed out that the security guards of former MP Duminda Silva have returned fire as part of discharging their duty. They did so after the first shots were fired by the Bharatha Lakshman faction. He stated that the investigators have created false incidents with the intention of making former MP guilty although he is innocent in that incident. The President Counsel further stated that such factors were pointed out during the trial; however, they were not analyzed before convicting the former MP. The President Counsel who quoted the High Court verdict also said that the vital evidence including the Government Analyst&rsquo;s reports was not analyzed before issuing the verdict. President Counsel, Anura Meddegoda pointed out to the bench of Supreme Court Judges that under such circumstances, there is no any legitimacy in the verdict that convicted former MP Duminda Silva. On the previous hearings, the President Counsels proved before the Supreme Court that every evidence submitted in an attempt to make former MP Duminda Silva guilty were contradictory and, the Court verdict has stated itself that none of the evidence that was given during trial could be treated as 100 percent acceptable. They stated that Duminda Silva has been made guilty for some offenses that were not in the charge sheet and such action cannot be legal for whatsoever. They stated that there were contradictions and omissions in the evidence that were fabricated to make former MP Duminda Silva guilty. Although such contradictions and omissions were pointed out during the High Court trial, they were not properly treated before giving the verdict. They further pointed out that the CID has filed forged charges against former MP Duminda Silva by creating fabricated incidents. The President Counsels pointed out that former MP Duminda Silva was indicted for using firearms but no any evidence was submitted during the trial. They said that the Bharatha Lakshman faction had first started the shooting where former MP Duminda Silva became a victim, that incident was neglected in giving the verdict. The President Counsel said that it was proved well by sufficient evidence that former MP Duminda Silva was shot at first. However, the High Court verdict has stated that that incident was no pertinent and, it was the best example to that effect. They also said that judicial medical reports have also confirmed that former MP Duminda Silva received gunshots on his forehead. He said the High court verdict has been given not on the submissions or evidence made before the Court but it has been given merely on former MP Duminda Silva\u2019s popular political recognition. They said although the verdict is read one hundred thousand times, it is not possible to understand why former MP Duminda Silva has been convicted. Therefore the president counsels proved before the Supreme Court that the High court verdict that convicted former MP Duminda Silva is not legitimate at all. They said the High court judge has given the verdict, without examining whether the evidence is proved beyond reasonable doubt but based on the opinions submitted by the state counsels. The President Counsels further pointed out before the Supreme Court that the High Court has ignored the submissions made by the Duminda Silva faction or the defence submissions and, has conducted the trial based on the fictitious incidents and evidence. He said that this Case was filed to tarnish the image of former MP Duminda Silva, therefore, he has been denied a justifiable trial similar to that of any other citizen is entitled to in this Case. The appeal will be called again tomorrow. ( )", "intro": "", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/8886-bharatha-faction-fired-first-verdict-given-against-duminda-not-lawful"},

{"topic": "UN informed again on 49 unvetted Sri Lanka soldiers in", "full_news": "Inner City Press was sent a copy of the letters, and published them - then asked UN Spokesman Stephane Dujarric for the UN's response. All he said, at noon on April 6, is that he would check to see that the letter has been received. More than 24 hours later, he has not provided even that confirmation. Meanwhile, Inner City Press later on April 6 asked Lacroix on the ramp to the turnstile Dujarric's eviction make it unable to get through if he was aware of the letters. He indicated that he is. So why no answer from Antonio Guterres' holdover spokesman Dujarric? Lacroix has now received another letter, from the \"Association Bharathi CCFT - Centre Culturel Franco Tamoul.\" If the past is any guide, he will stonewall on human rights and corruption issues by withholding even this response for three days, while continuing restrictions on the Press. Here is the text of the letter sent to Lacroix, to the UN in Geneva and to Inner City Press: TO JEAN-PIERRE LACROIX, UNDER SECRETARY GENERAL FOR UN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS, NEW YORK. OHCHR, Geneva Inner City Press 6 April 2018 Dear Mr. Lacroix, SRI LANKAN ARMY\u2019S FLOUTING OF VETTING AGREEMENT FOR UN PEACEKEEPERS We write to draw your attention to allegations that the Sri Lankan Army has deployed UN peacekeepers in violation of the vetting agreement it reached with the National Human Rights Commission, as well as their obligation to conduct their own due diligence process to ensure that those who may constitute a risk to peacekeeping are not sent out. The failure to abide by these commitments constitutes a mockery of the whole process. Below are also a few remedial steps we think should be taken now. The complaint regarding the vetting comes from no less than the country\u2019s National Human Rights Commission (HRCSL), a body appointed by the Government itself. You can see this complaint in a Sinhala letter from the HRCSL to the President of Sri Lanka in his capacity as commander in chief on the HRCSL website. The gist of it has been reported in English by exiled Sri Lankan journalists. It says that the HRCSL and the Sri Lankan Army signed an agreement in 2016 for the HRCSL to vet Sri Lanka\u2019s peacekeepers but the Army deployed 49 of them to Lebanon on 18 February 2018 before this process was complete and they had handed over all the information on them requested by the HRCSL. Indeed, some of the information requested by the HRCSL is said to be still pending. Ultimately the responsibility lies with your department for the vetting process in terms of the Secretary General\u2019s \u2018Zero Tolerance\u201d policy on Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA) as well as his new policy statement which he announced in 2017 \u201cSpecial Measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse:\u00a0\u00a0A New Approach\u201d, which has clearly failed spectacularly again in Sri Lanka.\u00a0\u00a0According to the UN, it seeks to ensure that only \u201cindividuals with the highest standards of integrity, competence and efficiency\u201d are hired \u2013 this has not been the record with regard to Sri Lanka. You will note that to date there has been no criminal accountability for the 134 Sri Lankan peacekeepers sent home from Haiti in connection with systematic child sexual exploitation from 2004-7, which was confirmed by an OIOS investigation. Furthermore, if your department allows peacekeepers from any country to deploy before the vetting process in place is complete, then you are complicit in undermining the vetting process. We, therefore, call on DPKO: So what will the UN do? On the morning of April 6, Secretary General Antonio Guterres' spokesman Stephane Dujarric who evicted Inner City Press from the UN Press Briefing Room where the UN Correspondents Association was meeting blithely said, just go to UNCA. Well, no - Sri Lanka history here. Back in February 2018 Lacroix was informed of the troubling past history in 2008 in Sri Lanka of a commander that country is seeking to deploy to the UN in Lebanon as early as February 18, Rathnappuli Wasantha Kumara Hewage, Inner City Press was informed and exclusively reported on February 14, and got confirmed from the UN on February 15. Now on February 19, UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said that following questions, the deployment of Hewage has been suspended. Video here; transcript: \"We were asked last week about a Sri Lankan officer who was scheduled to deploy to the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL.\u00a0\u00a0I can confirm that the officer\u2019s deployment is on hold pending a review of the matter.\u00a0\u00a0A decision regarding deployment of this officer will be made once the review is complete. We are in communication with the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka regarding the officer\u2019s background and Sri Lanka is cooperating fully with our inquiries. The United Nations takes reports of potential human rights violations very seriously.\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of policy, we are committed to ensuring that all personnel serving with the UN meet the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, including respect for and commitment to human rights.\" But why not canceled, given his record? We'll have more on this. When Lacroix held a rare press conference on January 24, Inner City Press asked him how the UN is vetting \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d from Cameroon, as that country's army is burning down whole villages in the Anglophone zones. Lacroix insisted that vetting is intensive. Inner City Press asked about what sources tell it, that the ostensibly vetting of troops from Sri Lanka, after the bloodbath on the beach there, consists of one OHCHR staffer in Geneva. Lacroix said he wasn't sure on that. Video here. After the press conference Inner City Press was contacted, and ultimately copied on a letter to Lacroix, below. On February 15, Inner City Press asked UN Spokesman Stephane Dujarric, UN transcript here: Inner City Press: there's been a letter sent by\u2026 by a number of Tamil Sri Lankan groups to Mr. [Jean-Pierre] Lacroix about the\u2026 the impending\u2026 I guess, some type of a commander in UNIFIL [United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon], Mr. [Rathnappuli Wasantha Kumara] Hewage.\u00a0\u00a0And they've documented to him \u2014 he's supposed to deploy on Sunday \u2014 that, in fact, he was present during 2008 in Kilinochchi, 2009 in PTK.\u00a0\u00a0These were, you know, highly controversial military actions.\u00a0\u00a0So, their complaint is that, in the past, Office of Human Rights of the UN would vet people, and now that doesn't appear to be the case anymore just by\u2026\u00a0\u00a0Have you seen that letter? Spokesman:\u00a0\u00a0We've\u2026 DPKO [Department of Peacekeeping Operations] has, indeed, received the letter you mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0They are looking into the case of the gentleman that you mentioned with\u2026 who's scheduled be deployed to Lebanon.\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of policy, we're committed to ensuring that all personnel serving with the UN meet the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, including respect for and commitment to human rights.\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with existing policy, the UN should neither select nor deploy for service any individual who has been involved in violations of international human rights or humanitarian law.\u00a0\u00a0In reviewing the background of personnel to be deployed, we consider available information from within and outside of the UN system, thus, will review carefully the information that has been provided to us.\u00a0\u00a0Member States that provide UN personnel to peacekeeping operations also have the responsibility to certify that the personnel they nominate have not been involved, by act or omission, in violations of international humanitarian or human rights law or have been repatriated on disciplinary grounds from any UN operation.\u00a0\u00a0In cases where we have concerns regarding the human rights record of specific troop-contributing countries, we put in place additional measures to ensure that the personnel deployed is in line with the UN human rights screening policy. Inner City Press: one follow-up, because I remember Mr. Lacroix specifically commented on this when he did his press conference.\u00a0\u00a0Seems like these\u2026 these\u2026 these groups are saying that, in the past, the UN review these in Geneva, and now they're relying on Sri Lanka's own human rights commission, and they say the last people were deployed\u2026 Spokesman:\u00a0\u00a0I think from what I understood of what I just said, we review both what the Government tells us and external and internal sources.\" We'll see. Here was the letter, c/o Debbie Berman, Copy to OHCHR, Geneva and InnerCityPress: Dear Mr. Lacroix, STOP DEPLOYMEMNT OF UN PEACEKEEPER WITH FRONTLINE COMBAT EXPERIENCE IN SRI LANKA\u2019S 2009 WAR - This is to request you to stop the planned deployment to Lebanon on Sunday 18 February 2018 of a Sri Lankan contingent commander with frontline combat command experience in the final phase of the civil war in 2008-9. We believe that under the UN\u2019s current vetting criteria, this commander should have been screened out of all UN peacekeeping duties. We note that the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka has been asked to vet UN peacekeepers from Sri Lanka but consider that ultimately the responsibility lies with your department, as according to the UN, it seeks to ensure that only \u201cindividuals with the highest standards of integrity, competence and efficiency\u201d are hired. The Sri Lankan Army says Lt. Col. Rathnappuli Wasantha Kumara Hewage is due to head the 12th Force Protection Company (FPC) for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) An online search of Lt. Col. Hewage reveals he was involved in the assault on Kilinochchi town in Northern Sri Lanka on 22 December 2008 and located in PTK in late February 2009.\" Inner City Press accompanied and covered Ban Ki-moon's trip to Sri Lanka in 2009, and subsequent acceptance of Shavendra Silva as a senior UN Peacekeeping adviser. After Inner City Press published how Palitha Kohona got his former landlord to sponsor, on behalf of the UN Correspondents Association, a screening of the government's genocide denial film \"Lies Agreed To,\" Inner City Press was threatened with ouster from the UN, which occurred, and Inner City Press is still restricted to minders under the Department of Public Information run by British Alison Smale.

{"topic": "Victory shouldn't be celebrated by audacious rhetoric -", "full_news": "He said this in a press communiqu\u00e9 issued in this regard, noting that victory should be celebrated not by audacious rhetoric. The full text of his commemorative message is as follows : The LTTE organization which saw its birth in 1983 as a minor group grew to be one of the most ruthless terrorist organizations in the world by the year 2009. LTTE organization, equipped with infantry, fire-power, naval strength and a certain degree of air power gained world-wide\u00a0 notoriety as the terrorist group which inducted the 'suicide bomb' concept to the world. The unfailing commitment, tireless dedication, bravery and courage as well as proper planning of Army, Navy and Air Force members enabled them to rescue thousands of innocent Tamil civilians, used as human shields and win over the LTTE which has by then taken to a cycle of terrorism with the support of the international Diaspora for creation of an Eelam state. Accordingly, terrorism was completely eradicated on 19 May 2009 after capturing the last patch of land, held by terrorists. Towards it, Sri Lanka Police and Civil Security Department also made an invaluable contribution. War Heroes of the Army (23,962), Navy (1160), Air Force (443), together with 2598 Policemen and 456 Civil Security Department members made the supreme sacrifice in defence of the Motherland, thus enabling all Sri Lankans to enjoy the present day's spirits of freedom. All of them sacrificed their tomorrow for our today while defending the sovereignty, territorial integrity and the unitary status of Sri Lanka. Likewise, the selfless contribution and sacrifices made by all Sri Lankans who were under threat of LTTE terrorism for 30 years is worth recalling here. Not only that, all Sri Lankans as of today lead their lives freely, thanks to the fulfillment of timely responsibilities of our political leadership. Nine years have passed by 19 May 2018 since the eradication of terrorism from our soil. I firmly believe the freedom thus gained should be shared not by exaggerated glorification or through mere rhetoric and hyperbole but by showing our sentiments of deep gratitude to fallen Tri Service, Police, Civil Security Department members and civilians who rooted terrorism out. Great War Heroes, pertinent to mention here, must not therefore be manipulated to serve narrow objectives and personal agendas, nor should they be incited to resort to emotional and anti-social acts. Sri Lanka Army in order to pay tribute and commemorate fallen War Heroes has launched a special programme. Accordingly, religious observances in commemoration of them have been organized at all regimental formations, followed by reading of my special message of tribute. Besides, National War Heroes' Day commemoration, headed by HE the President Maithripala Sirisena, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces will take place on Saturday (19) at the National War Heroes' Monument in Battaramulla, followed by a mega Army-supported 'Aaloka Pooja' Pinkama, the same evening at the historic Kelaniya Rajamaha Viharaya premises. Many numbers of fearless War Heroes during the course of 30 years sacrificed their valuable lives, sweat and blood to decide on our future. They all sighed their last breath to the air on that day, expecting ever-lasting bonds of peace and reconciliation would prevail. They would ever never have wished the recurrence of a war even in a dream during their cycle of future births. Therefore, as envisaged by them in the past, we should pursue wisely, avoid recurrence of any war at all and preserve hard-earned freedom for generations, still to be born. At this moment, I wish all brave War Heroes who sacrificed their lives for protection of the country's unitary status and precious lives of the general public attain supreme bliss of Nibbhana. Similarly, let me wish speedy recovery to all differently able War Heroes still under recuperation\u00a0\u00a0 and medical treatment. Not only that, I take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to all spouses, children, parents, next of kin of gallant War Heroes and neighbours for their invaluable dedication and sacrifice while we, as brave members of the Army, were leading in the battlefields.", "intro": "War heroes should not be manipulated to fulfil anyone\u2019s petty and private agendas while gratitude should be shown to war heroes without resorting to impulsive anti-social activities, said Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/8643-victory-shouldn-t-be-celebrated-by-audacious-rhetoric-army-commander"},

Everest Expeditions. For the past few weeks, Johann has been performing a series of climbing rotations which prepare the climbers for higher altitudes and the Himalayan terrain. Johann has completed three such training rotations, climbing all the way up to Camp 3 which is 7,162m above sea level and the fourth highest peak in the world. He has also been undergoing a series of ladder training exercises and other glacier-trekking exercises to help him prepare for the final stage of his Everest climb. Johann and other climbers have been experiencing bad weather throughout the current climbing season, and it is hoped the jet streams at the summit will ease in time for the final summit ascent. This last phase of Johann\u2019s climb is the most treacherous and also most challenging \u2013 the area beyond Camp 4 and the Summit is known as the Death Zone because of its perilous conditions, where strong winds, narrow plateaus, steep ridges await the climbers and because in this zone the organs of the body start to slowly shut down because of the depleted oxygen saturation in the air. Johann has been in intense training for this climb since December 2017. This is Johann\u2019s second attempt to summit Mount Everest. In April 2016, he and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala were the first Sri Lankans to attempt to summit the peak, but Johann was forced to turn back at 8,400m, a mere 448m short of reaching the summit, due to technical difficulties with his equipment. Kuru-Utumpala went on to complete the climb, becoming the first Sri Lankan to scale Mt. Everest. Encouraging Johann on this second Everest bid is the \u2018Climb Everest with Johann\u2019 campaign, which has drawn the support of hundreds of Sri Lankans through its dedicated website. The campaign allows Johann\u2019s Fellow-Sri Lankans to sponsor each step he takes on the mountain for Rs.100 a step. The cost of Johann\u2019s expedition is estimated to amount to USD 58,600 and each sponsored step goes towards these costs. Johann has dedicated this Everest Expedition to all Sri Lankans, and he is hopeful of raising the Sri Lankan Flag at the Everest Summit in a few days.

The doctor, who posted the appeal will be asked to explain, he says. |The hospital has a medical officer responsible for matters of donations, who is Dr. Nayanatara Ranawaka, who can be reached on telephone no. 0112693711, says its director. Given below is the social media appeal in question: Public Appeal from the Children's Heart Centre, Lady Ridgeway Hospital The following appeal is by Dr. Xxxxxxx xxxxx a child heart specialist working at the Children\u2019s Heart Centre at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children in Colombo. 09th April 2018 Each day around 3-5 heart surgeries are carried out on little ones from all parts of our country free of charge. I would say that 85% of the parents of these children are from a very poor socio-economic backgrounds, and even find providing basics for their families an uphill task. Once the child is admitted to the ICU following cardiac surgery, the parents are requested to provide pampers for the child which could range from 4-10 pampers per day, and sometimes for 1-2 weeks or even longer, depending on the length of their stay in the ICU. This has placed a tremendous financial burden on these parents as a pamper costs Rs. 50 (purchased retail), who can barely afford the bus fare to come and visit their children in hospital. Recently, there were incidents where parents had even resorted to desperate measures such as stealing pampers from others as they have been unable to afford them on their own. The hospital requires approx. 4000 pampers per month. I wish to earnestly request you to look into the possibility of assisting us in providing a solution to this hidden problem. Let\u2019s do something so that another mother would not have to undergo the same humiliating experience which I feel no one should ever have to experience.

The Appeal by former MP Duminda Silva requesting the Court to acquit him was first taken for consideration before a bench of 5 Supreme Court Judges chaired by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep on March 27th. Making submissions for the Appellant, President Counsel, and Anil de Silva who pointed out the faults of the High Court verdict said that it was schemed to convict former MP Duminda Silva. He said that the verdict has been given by the Judge solely based on the statements made by the State Counsels. The Judge has not scrutinized whether the evidence was proved beyond reasonable doubt. The President Counsel pointed out before the Supreme Court that Duminda Silva was accused of using firearms but no evidence was given during the trial to prove such charges. He further stated that irrelevant evidence was given with regard to other charges as well. He said that 62 contradictions and shortcomings were marked during the trial. The President Counsel said that such benefits of the doubt should have been given to the Duminda Silva faction but the Judge has neglected to do so. In addition, the President Counsel logically proved that incidents were concocted intending to make Duminda Silva guilty. He pointed out that the shooting at Duminda Silva was instigated by Bharatha Lakshman faction. However such action was completely overlooked by the judge when she issued her verdict. President Counsel Anil de Silva further pointed out before the Supreme Court that the High Court has ignored the say by the Duminda Silva faction or Defence submissions and has conducted trial solely based on the fictitious incidents and evidence. He said that this Case was filed to tarnish the image of former MP Duminda Silva, therefore, he was denied of a justifiable trial similar to that of any other citizen is entitled to in this Case. Therefore, President Counsel Anil Silva requested the Supreme Court to overrule the verdict which has unlawfully sentenced former MP Duminda Silva and acquit him from all the charges. Later, the Case was taken before the bench of 5 Supreme Court judges again for the third day today. Making submissions before the Court, President Counsel Anuja Premarathna also stated that the verdict given against former MP Duminda Silva was unlawful. The President Counsel who pointed out the shortcomings of the verdict under 10 factors said that the verdict was given neither on the evidence nor on the submissions. He said it was given on the fact that Duminda Silva is a popular political icon. He further said that although the verdict is read one hundred thousand times, it is not possible to understand why Duminda Silva has been convicted. The President Counsel said that the shortcomings and contradictions of the false evidence that created to make Duminda Silva guilty, have been marked during the trial. Quoting the evidence of the High Court, the President Counsel stated that the Court did not explain the reason to not consider such doubts before it gave a unilateral verdict. He said that the High Court has given a sentence for possessing a firearm without any evidence to prove it. The President Counsel said that the verdict by the High Court itself has stated that a single Judge of the three-member bench has no authority to mete out punishment. Thus, President Counsel Anuja Premarathna proved before the bench of five Supreme Court Judges that the verdict which convicted former MP Duminda Silva is neither an actual nor an authentic verdict. The Appeal will be called again for further trial on this Thursday.

{"topic": "Scientists discover dozens of new genes for hair colour", "full_news": "A test based on the new genetic markers was 10-20% more accurate than existing forensic tests and was most reliable for red or black hair, with brown or blond hair proving harder to predict, researchers said. \u201cIf someone leaves blood at a crime scene, you could say from their DNA whether they had black or red hair with about 90% certainty,\u201d said Tim Spector, a lead author on the work at King\u2019s College London. The colour of a person\u2019s hair is one of the most heritable features of their appearance, with studies on twins suggesting that genetics explains up to 97% of hair colour. Until now scientists have known of only 13 genes that affect where an individual\u2019s hair will lie on the scale from light to dark. After studying the DNA of nearly 300,000 people, researchers from King\u2019s and Erasmus MC in Rotterdam uncovered 124 genes that contributed to hair colour, either by directly affecting the production and distribution of the natural pigment melanin or through other biological mechanisms, many of which are still unclear. The fresh haul of hair colour genes explain 35% of red hair, 25% of blond hair and 26% of black hair, according to the study, reported in the journal Nature Genetics. It is likely that hundreds of other genes also affect hair colour in ways that were too subtle for the scientists to detect. One factor that complicates a forensic test for hair colour is the common tendency for children who are born blond to have their hair turn brown a handful of years later. While that change itself could well be driven by genes, the researchers found none that seemed to explain the effect. \u201cWe know that some blond kids become brown but we have no idea why that is,\u201d said Manfred Kayser, a senior author on the paper at Erasmus MC. Perhaps more intriguing was the discovery of marked differences in hair colour among the men and women who took part in the study. The scientists, who drew on data gathered by the UK BioBank and the US genetics company 23andMe, found that women were 25% more likely to report having blond hair than men, and three times less likely to say they had dark hair. While the scientists cannot rule out that some participants were mistaken about their own hair colour, the numbers are in line with findings from other studies that used optical instruments to measure hair colour. In the past the differences have been attributed to sexual preferences, with women supposedly preferring darker men and men preferring blond women. \u201cIf this was going on, it\u2019s hard to prove,\u201d said Kayser. Beyond casting light on the biology of human hair colour, the research gives scientists fresh insights into genes linked to diseases such as skin cancer. \u201cPigments are far more than just cosmetic \u2013 they are important for the immune system and play a role in many diseases,\u201d said Spector. \u201cUnderstanding the genetics could lead to new therapies.\u201d (theguardian.com)", "intro": "Forensic scientists are a step closer to predicting the colour of a suspect\u2019s hair from their DNA alone after the discovery of more than 100 new genes that influence the shade of a person\u2019s locks.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/8281-scientists-discover-dozens-of-new-genes-for-hair-colour"},

The appearance of all tobacco packs is standardized, including the colour of the pack. The removal of branding on cigarette packaging aims to deter smoking by removal of positive associations of brands (including design and symbol) with the consumption of tobacco. It also aims to remove an available avenue of brand advertising for cigarette companies. Australia was the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging, with all packets sold from 1 December 2012 being sold in logo-free, drab dark brown packaging. There has been opposition from tobacco companies to plain packaging laws, some of which have sued the Australian government. Since the Australian government won the court cases, several other countries have enacted plain packaging laws.

The media conference was convened to disclose the steps taken by the authorities following an sexual harassment and assault on a Dutch tourist group in Mirissa on April 8th. It was noted at the media briefing that while six have already been arrested on this connection, several more arrests are to be made. Mr. Ukwatte said that if strict measures are not taken on this regard, it will deeply affect the tourism industry. The association disclosed that even hotel managers face threats when standing up against 'beach boys'. Speaking at the media briefing, police media spokesperson - SP Ruwan Gunasekara said that measures are also being taken to arrest those behind the assault of Israeli surfers in the Mirissa area on April 15. Several cases of assault on tourists were reported from the Unawatuna and Mirissa areas in the recent past and local youth known as 'beach boys' were considered as main culprits. SP Gunasekara said in the wake of this incident a block of land had been acquired to set up a tourist police in Mirissa. Speaking to 'BBC Sandeshaya', Prashans Barns, the secretary of the Tourist Guides collective said that these beach boys do not even allow tourists to enter some beach areas. Police say that they have found it hard to take measures against beach boys as tourists are not intent on reporting such instances of harassment. \u201cWe are sorry about what happened and apologize to those tourists for the harassment they faced. We guarantee absolute safety in future for tourists, with the support of the Police,\u201d the minister said.

{"topic": "SriLankan, Civil Aviation Authority in dogfight over new aircraft\u2019", "full_news": "But the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL)\u2013the industry regulator\u2013also hit back strongly, questioning why the aircraft was dispatched by SriLankan management for commercial flights \u201cwith known defects in its engines, without proper investigation for identification of causal factor and necessary rectification\u201d. \u201cWe observed that the airline had merely followed certain written procedures in the manuals without giving weighted attention to the sound maintenance practices that shall be applied based on sound Safety Management Principles which advocate proactive and predictive approach for identification of hazardous conditions with a view to eliminating possible risks, rather than being reactive which entails adverse ramifications,\u201d said H M Nimalsiri, Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), in written comments to the Sunday Times. This newspaper exclusively reported last week that SriLankan Airlines lost certification to operate its new A320neo and A321neo aircraft for more than an hour outside the range of airports suitable for emergency landings after its Maintenance Department released one of the planes (registration 4R-ANE) for use despite having detected debris in the oil monitoring system of an engine. As a result, the A321neo aircraft flying as UL 898 to Hong Kong on January 21, 2018, was forced to shut down the engine in question and divert to Bangkok on a single engine. After an investigation, the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL) immediately withdrew certification granted to the airline \u201cto conduct A320/321 aircraft on ETOPs [Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards] with 90 minutes diversion time\u201d. The CAASL said at the time that it did not find any cogent reason for the company\u2019s Maintenance Department to have released the A321neo aircraft for service after detecting debris in the oil monitoring system of one engine (which has direct impact on flight safety) \u201cwithout analysing the debris and taking appropriate preventive/corrective measures\u201d, in a letter to SriLankan. Without ETOPS approval, a flight must always be within 60 minutes of an emergency or diversion airport. With certification, however, it may fly longer\u2013in the case of the A320-321neos, at least 90 minutes\u2013outside the range of a suitable landing area. The IFSD of a CFM LEAP 1A engine on aircraft 4R-ANE \u201ccan in no way be attributed to a lapse on the part of the maintenance staff\u201d, the airline claimed, in a written response. Attributing the event to a manufacture design failure, it insisted, \u201cNo serious lapses in procedures or working practices of Maintenance Department have been identified.\u201d The company said the relevant department had an impeccable track record with multiple national aviation authority approvals for maintenance of third party aircraft. \u201cThe initial investigations carried out by the engine manufacturer CFM International (CFMI) confirmed that the in-flight shutdown on 4R-ANE was due to an internal bearing failure,\u201d it continued. The manufacturing defect could be attributed to a number of cases, it said, including (but not limited to) material failures, workmanship, manufacturing processes, improper tooling, quality escapes during assembly and damage during transportation, etc. Four such failures (IFSDs) have been reported worldwide on aircraft of various airlines and CFMI is currently investigating the root cause, SriLankan said: \u201cCFMI continues to remotely monitor all aircraft operating the LEAP 1A engine using condition monitoring technology and will alert operators regarding any future issues.\u201d The company also said it was in active discussions with the CAASL with regard to the restoration of its ETOPS certification for aircraft fitted with the LEAP 1A engines. The regulator countered, however, that \u201cafter detecting the engines to have developed a serious problem requiring shutting down engine in-flight, as a responsible civil aviation regulators, CAASL cannot just allow the airline to continue\u201d. \u201cIt has accordingly taken immediate action to withdraw the 90 minutes ETOPS approval and also commenced conducting detailed investigation to find out causal factor(s),\u201d Mr Nimalsiri asserted. \u201cDuring this process the entire episode behind the incident would be dissected for detailed analysis of system errors/deficiencies with a view to rectifying aiming at enhanced flight safety.\u201d SriLankan also said in its statement that the airframe manufacturer Airbus Industrie has calculated that the in-flight shutdown rate of the A320neo/CFM LEAP 1A (including the last SriLankan Airlines event) to be 0.008/1000EH. It said this is well below the IFSD rate target of 0.0225/1000EH for ETOPS 180 minutes as defined by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Responding to this technical point, the DGCA asserted that the statistics only help one understand \u201cthe probability of occurrence of something in the absence of real time evidence about the possibility of its happening\u201d. \u201cOf course, in granting ETOPS with 90 minutes diversion time, CAASL based its decision on world fleet statistics,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, our assumptions were proven to be wrong with SriLankan Airline\u2019s own experience.\u201d The 4R-ANE aircraft began operations on December 20, 2017, and had performed only 202 flight cycles and 595 flight hours when IFSD occurred on January 20, 2018. \u201cIn relation to SriLankan Airline\u2019s own experience, it is much higher than the IFSD ratio,\u201d he pointed out.", "intro": "SriLankan Airlines this week mounted an impassioned defence of its Maintenance Department, blaming January\u2019s in-flight shutdown (IFSD) of an engine on UL898 to Bangkok on \u201ca global issue that has occurred on identical engines fitted to aircraft of other airlines\u201d.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/8151-srilankan-civil-aviation-authority-in-dogfight-over-new-aircraft-s-safety-issue"},

{"topic": "Harmful emissions from Lakvijaya coal power plant", "full_news": "The electrostatic precipitator (ESP) of unit 1 has been running at below optimum for nearly one month. There are conflicting reports about the level of efficiency, with internal sources maintaining it has dropped as low as 40 percent. But a spokesman for the Power and Energy Ministry downplayed the problem. The ESP is also called an electrostatic air cleaner. It is a filtration device that removes fine particles\u2013in this case, fly ash\u2013from a flowing gas. \u201cThe ESP has sixteen fields to filter ash,\u201d said Sulakshana Jaywardena, the Ministry\u2019s Director (Development). \u201cFive are not working but the other eleven are functioning. If you visit the plant, you can see the flame and that the issue is not so bad.\u201d He confirmed, however, that the Ceylon Electricity Board\u2019s (CEB) Deputy General Manager had requested permission from its General Manager to shut down the unit\u2013the coal power plant\u2019s oldest one, having been commissioned in 2011\u2013to facilitate repairs. \u201cIf there is a considerable issue, we will shut down and do the repair,\u201d he said. But the Wayamba Provincial Council Environmental Authority (WPCEA) has clearly instructed the CEB to fix the problem now. \u201cWe have been giving them time,\u201d said Saman Lenaduwa, the Authority\u2019s head. \u201cWe will stop giving them excuses hereafter. They will have to shut down the plant, if necessary, and do the repairs.\u201d A meeting in this regard was held on Thursday. \u201cIt is not a question of how many are not working,\u201d an environmentalist said, requesting anonymity. \u201cEven if one field is broken, you are not meeting the required conditions and, therefore, clearly violating legal requirements. Why is Lakvijaya measured with a different yardstick to other organisations in the country?\u201d Lakvijaya has also been running with a valid environmental protection licence (EPL) since June last year. But the old one clearly specifies that particulate matter must be below 150 milligrams per cubic metre (mg/Nm3). \u201cThe particulate matter output in untreated flue gas is 12332 mg/Nm3,\u201d the environmentalist said. \u201cTo get it below 150 mg/Nm3 which is the national standard, the minimum ESP efficiency should be around 99%.\u201d Another vital environmental protection device called the flue-gas desulphurizer (FGD) was also broken for ten days and repaired only this week, internal sources said. This was confirmed by the WPCEA but denied by the Ministry. This instrument removes sulphur dioxide from the flue gas. The FGD in question is also in unit 1. \u201cWe have a seawater FGD,\u201d said the environmentalist earlier quoted. \u201cThe smoke out of the boiler first goes through the ESP which removes the dust by using electrostatic charges. The seawater FDG then removes the sulphur dioxide from the filtered smoke. The problem is that the FGD will not work properly if the ESP is not functioning well.\u201d Fly ash is toxic, he pointed out. With the ESP not working at optimum levels, part of this matter gets discharged into the ocean. \u201cSo now we have sea pollution on top of the ESP problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout the FGD, the pollution is in the atmosphere. With it, it\u2019s in the sea. Either way it\u2019s bad. And the CEB still hasn\u2019t shut down the unit to fix the ESP.\u201d The activist pointed to another environmental issue at Norochcholai. \u201cThe cooling towers need a lot of water,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is obtained through three ocean intakes.

However, having educated the minister on the effectiveness of social media campaigning, he had understood its significance and focused his attention to the issue.

Born in Negombo, Sri Lanka he had initially attended the Nainamaduwa Roman Catholic school later St. Joseph Vaz College in Wennappuwa after Grade V. Having got through his A/L examination in the Math stream in 1977, he could not enter university. However, he joined the Fisheries Corporation as a technical officer. Subsequently, having gone to Italy through a connection, he had paved his way right up to becoming an regional MP in Italy. Explaining his journey in Italy, he said, \u201cIt was when I arrived in Italy that I understood that it was not possible to get a job here with the qualifications I had gained from Sri Lanka. All those who come to Italy from other countries only get to do minor jobs. I too had to work in homes, restaurants and other menial jobs. It was a very tough time. Then I got a job as an assistant at a modeling agency, where I worked for two years. Then I got a job as a caretaker of an apartment complex. That was a good break for me and I worked there for 18 years. However, in 2007 I lost that job. Then I returned to Sri Lanka in 2007 and engaged in business.\u201d Having married a Philippine lady as he arrived in Italy initially, they have one daughter who had completed her initial studies in Italy and moved to London for higher education. She is currently married to a Sri Lankan. This is what he had to say about his election win. \u201cAfter 10 years of holding Italian citizenship, one can become a public representative. But, here its not like Sri Lanka. One must have studied political science to get into politics. My biggest challenge was the language and how to use it comprehensively. I attended classes in order to study these subjects. Otherwise, no one would have voted for me.\u201d \u201cThe Italian Democratic Party is a leftist party. There is also an association formed by the Sri Lankans here known as the People\u2019s public centre.\u201d This association maintains links with the Democratic Party and the party had notified that several migrants will be given the chance to contest. There were many who came forward from the Philippines, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, several African countries and Latin American countries. However, I was fortunate to receive nominations. There were four others from various countries that also contested this election. I contested from the Lombardy province, which is a very wealthy province. They did not have much regard for the leftist ideologies and we knew that. But we contested legally. Unlike in Sri Lanka there is no prolonged rallies and you don\u2019t have to spend millions. All I had to do was print my election manifesto and distribute it among the people. It only cost me 450 Euros, which is around 85,000. Our party gained 30% of the votes. Had the other minor parties not got such a low percentage, we could have joined up and won, but that is another fascinating story.\u201d \u201cAlthough there was an election on March 24, there was no loud sounds. Even if you win, you cannot make much noise. For example, if I were to meet the Health Minister at a shop to buy my bread, he would have to stand behind me if he came after me. Just because he is the minister he would not get any preferential treatment,\u201d explained Niranjan, next talking of his future plans. \u201cWhatever happens, Sri Lanka is my country of birth and I will return when I reach retirement. I love Sri Lanka, but I will never be able to enter Sri Lanka\u2019s mudslinging politics,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Sri Lanka, an election means causing a huge din but in Italy it is quite different.

Nine-month-old Dharuniga and Kopiga, two, were separated from their parents and the whole family were taken 1,500km from Queensland to Melbourne. In Melbourne they said they were told they could not call anyone until they signed documents agreeing to their deportation. After two days they signed the papers and then called their local community doctor to tell them of their plight. On Tuesday, over a week after their initial arrest, the family were then flown on separate flights from Melbourne to Perth. \u00a0 It was only when they were put on the plane bound from Perth to Sri Lanka with other Tamil deportees that the injunction was applied and the family were taken off. It was filed by their lawyers but the grounds are not known. The family are currently in a detention centre in Perth, 4,475 km from their Queensland home. Mr Hillier said of Tuesday's deportation attempt: \"This was a dastardly and reprehensible action. Dharuniga and Kopiga were born in Australia. This is their home - they have never been to Sri Lanka and do not hold Sri Lankan citizenship.\" Ms Fredericks said: \"Handcuffed like criminals. Separating babies and infants from parents. Has Australia learnt nothing from our history? I urge the government to take a long look and think about what it is doing.\" A department of home affairs spokesman said the family's case had been comprehensively assessed over many years. \"They have consistently been found not to meet Australia's protection obligations,\" he said according to local media, adding that the removal from the family home had been carried out safely. Dozens of people gathered on Wednesday evening for a vigil at a local park where Priya would bring her girls to meet other children. Ms Fredericks said of the family: \"As their friends and their community, we know these people and we love them and what they do for our community. We want them here.\" A second vigil, organised by mothers in Sydney, is to take place on Friday.", "intro": "A Tamil family seeking asylum in Australia were saved from deportation minutes before their plane for Sri Lanka was due to fly on Tuesday night.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/7666-deportation-family-get-last-minute-reprieve"},

{"topic": "\u2018Political leaders have to find a backbone to solve", "full_news": "He notes that after blocking the social media, purportedly to control racist violence, president Maithripala Sirisena later said it was taken in order for national security. Perera was making comments to Sri Lanka Mirror with regard to the US media having taken up the issue of the blockade of facebook, instagram, whattsapp and viber following the disturbances in Kandy. Sinhala Buddhist thugs\u2019 attacking mosques and Muslim businesses becomes a matter of national security only if they carry out the attacks on a foreign contract, he said, adding that there was no evidence yet to indicate as such. The root cause is the Sinhala Buddhist extremism started by Cyril Mathew, the onetime UNP general secretary who introduced violence at the 1983 Black July and the politics of J.R. Jayewardene, who fully supported it as the then head of state. Two weeks before the Black July, Jayewardene told Daily Telegraph in London that it was unimportant for him what the Tamils thought and expected, and that Sinhalese were happy if the Tamils went hungry, according to Perera. Thereafter, it was not social media, but the mainstream media that took that violence forward, said the journalist, adding that that not changed in the present too. Therefore, president Sirisena has spoiled everything by doing what Donald Trump did not try in the US. Blocking social media will not negate Sinhala Buddhist violence. It is only by banning all such organizations, arresting their leaders and taking them before courts that Sinhala Buddhist extremism can be countered. There are no Buddhists in this country who will oppose it, Perera said. Gnanasara Thera received only 5,727 Sinhala Buddhist votes from Kalutara at the 2015 August general election and there wasn\u2019t two dozens of people to carry out a picketing when he got arrested. Perera went onto say that the country\u2019s political leaders have to find a backbone and solve this violent extremism. Of the US media, CNBC news reported as follows under the heading \u2018Sri Lanka does what US can't: Pull the plug on Facebook over hate speech, fake news\u2019, about what is taking place in Sri Lanka: Another nation has joined the growing ranks of those saying Facebook's content-filtering systems aren't good enough. Sri Lanka, faced with online content it says has spurred deadly sectarian violence, this week banned Facebook's social media and messaging services in that country. By forcing internet service providers to pull the plug on Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook, the government there hopes to stem the spread of hate speech and fake news it blames for attacks on the country's Muslim minority. The ban came after several years in which critics have said Facebook and the government there were not doing enough to prevent the spread of such harmful posts. The move is also a reminder of why ridding social media sites of dangerous content may be hardest here in Facebook's own home country. Because the U.S. Constitution protects all speech except for threats which attempts to incite imminent violence, the government cannot arbitrarily force Facebook, YouTube (a unit of Alphabet), Twitter or other social media sites off the internet. \"We have clear rules against hate speech and incitement to violence and work hard to keep it off our platform.

The ban in Sri Lanka came the same week that Germany's new coalition government says it may revise a recently-enacted law to punish internet firms that don't remove hate speech quickly enough.

{"topic": "Minister allows Blue Ocean project despite legal disputes", "full_news": "The proposed \u2018Blue Ocean Layards Road\u2019 is advertised online by the developer as a luxury apartment complex of 14 storeys. But in June 2017, eleven residents of Layards Road filed a petition seeking to quash any preliminary planning clearance issued to Blue Ocean Breeze (Pvt) Ltd or D D Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) or the Colombo Municipality to erect a building of more than five floors. The basis of the legal challenge was that the plot on which Blue Ocean was putting up the highrise is a \u2018Special Primary Residential Zone\u2019 under the 2008 City of Colombo Development Plan (Amendment). The number of storeys allowed within such an area is five or ground plus four floors. In January this year, the residents once again petitioned the Court of Appeal for an interim order to prevent the developers from starting construction after learning that work was to begin soon. They sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the UDA or the municipality from issuing a fresh preliminary planning clearance or building permit for a construction exceeding five floors. They also want a writ of mandamus compelling the UDA or the municipality to demolish \u201can unauthorised construction\u201d should the developers proceed with the project, especially if it exceeds five floors. The petitioners express fear that, with the construction of an \u201cunauthorised high rise structure on the subject premises, the adjoining properties and buildings will suffer serious and irreparable damage including cracks to walls and foundations, quite apart from violation of applicable regulations and environmental concerns\u201d. But in a gazette dated January 18, 2018, Minister Champika Ranawaka (who also holds the portfolio of Western Development) has designated the front lots along the eastern side of Layards Road to be a \u2018Mixed Development Zone\u2019. This allows for the construction of offices, apartments, entertainment facilities and shops. The Minister\u2019s signature on the gazette is dated July 14, 2017, not long after the residents took the matter to court. The gazette gives effect to a revision of the City of Colombo Development Plan. The Urban Development Authority Law empowers the Minister to carry out periodic changes. The amendment now allows Blue Ocean to proceed with its project. The UDA rejected any suggestion that the amendment was introduced to favour a particular developer. But Chairman Jagath Nandana Munasinghe admitted that Blue Ocean made a request to implement the project in the Special Primary Residential Zone. \u201cThe developer pointed out that one side [western] of Layards Road is designated a Mixed Development Zone while the other side [eastern] is a Special Primary Residential Zone,\u201d Mr Munasinghe said. \u201cThe street is the boundary between the two and separate regulations apply to each side. However, the land value on both road-fronts is the same.\u201d There was no justification, he pointed out, for such a distinction to be maintained in the City of Colombo Development Plan when the land values on the eastern and western side of the road were the same. \u201cThe decision was not in favour of anyone,\u201d Mr Munasinghe said. \u201cThe UDA followed a procedure. The Act clearly prescribes how any changes to the Plan must be carried out. There may be certain development needs arising from time to time. These are referred to the Planning Committee appointed by the Minister and they make the decisions.\u201d The Committee, on policy grounds, ruled favourably on the developer\u2019s request, Mr Munasinghe said, adding that the change applies to all the lots facing Layards Road. This means other companies can now erect buildings on either side of the street. The Committee\u2019s outcome was referred to the Minister for validation through a gazette. The date of his signature was only \u201ca coincidence\u201d, Mr Munasinghe said. And the gazette was only issued in January because it \u201chad been lying in files\u201d at the UDA.

Currently, most of the weekend newspapers sell for around Rs. 60.00. According to Wijaya publications, the reason behind the price increase was the increase in printing paper in the international market, the rupee devaluation and high transport costs and increase in production costs. When we contacted Senior Journalist Kusal Perera regarding this sudden increase in price, he said, \u201cPeople don\u2019t buy the Lankadeepa newspaper to read the current news or for social value but they buy it for the advertisements. Hence, they will still buy the paper despite the steep increase,\u201d he said. He further stated, \u201cIn my view around 40% - 50% of the readers don\u2019t buy the Lankadeepa for its news value, but just for the advertisements on houses, lands and vehicles etc. Therefore, I don\u2019t think that the increase in the price of the newspaper will have a negative effect on its sales.\u201d \u201cHowever, the reasons cited by Wijaya publications for the increase is unjustified. They have increased the price of the newspaper just to maintain the profits earned from it. Based on the number and value of the advertisements in the paper, it can even be distributed free.

Most publishers used the papers to bargain with politicians. There is an electronic media institution that is clearly doing that at present. These electronic media institutions have no ethics and not an iota of shame. They use thuggery to do what they please. Even politicians believe that the media has such a power. Similarly there are those who launder their black money by using the media. Then they come for a short time and then close down the newspaper publications and later invest their laundered money in something else.

{"topic": "\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s courts double standards\u201d - UN Human", "full_news": "In his report on \"Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka\" to the 37th session of the Human Rights Council, which will be held from 26 February to 23 March 2018 in Geneva, the High Commissioner also called on Member States to explore other avenues, including the application of universal jurisdiction, that could foster accountability in Sri Lanka. \u201cA State\u2019s capacity or willingness to address impunity for gross violations and abuses of international human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law can, in part, be assessed by its approach to complex, serious cases,\u201d the UN High Commissioner charged. The death of 27 inmates during a security operation to control a riot at Welikada prison, in November 2012, the killing of protestors by army personnel at Weliwerya in August 2013, More than 10 years after the killing of five students in Trincomalee, in January 2006, and of 17 humanitarian workers of the non-governmental organization ACF, in Muttur, in August 2006, no noticeable progress has been made in ensuring accountability, the abduction and disappearance of 11 persons during 2008-2009, On 24 December 2016, the five defendants on trial for the murder of Member of Parliament Nadarajah Raviraj, Prageeth Ekneligoda\u2019s abduction and disappearance in 2010, the mass murder in Kumarapuram in 1996, and Lasantha\u2019s killing in 2009 are among the list of unresolved crimes. He notes that in almost all of these unresolved cases, almost all the security forces personnel involved have been released on bail. \u201cAn overall trait of the Sri Lankan justice system is the perceived double standards in the administation of justice with regard to treatment of State officials or security personnel accused in criminal proceedings,\u201d he pointed out.\u00a0 Hence, the argument of appointing a special court comprising specialised officers and international lawyers to take measures against state officials and military personnel who have committed grave crimes, is further justified, he said. A case not related to human rights violations but that illustrates the contradictions of the criminal justice system is the conviction, on 7 September 2017, of a former presidential secretary and a former director general of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission in a corruption case. Within hours of their entry into prison, both convicted officials had been relocated to the prison hospital, reportedly for health reasons. Ordinary convicts often complain of the difficulties they encounter in receiving medical treatment in prison, even for easily verifiable or urgent problems such as infections. On 20 September, the two convicts were released on bail \u201cunder exceptional circumstances\u201d by a Colombo High Court judge, after having served only 13 days of their 3-year prison term. This is exceptional in a system where suspects are often held on remand awaiting trial for up to 10 years, the report noted. On 28 August 2017, several Latin American human rights groups, coordinated by aninternational non-governmental organization, filed criminal complaints in Brazil andColombia, under the universal jurisdiction doctrine, against the then Ambassador of SriLanka to countries in the region, retired Army General Jagath Jayasuriya, for war crimesand crimes against humanity allegedly committed in the final phase of the civil war, in2009. The ambassador completed his tenure in the region and returned to Sri Lanka on 30August. An overall trait of the Sri Lankan justice system is the perceived double standards in the administration of justice with regard to treatment of State officials or security personnel accused in criminal proceedings. While the situation of human rights in Sri Lanka has improved overall since January 2015, there have been fewer signs of progress since the previous report of the High Commissioner. Several incidents targeting religious minorities, slow government reaction and response to some of those incidents and the controversial statements of some (then) key ministers have eroded the Government\u2019s image of being fully committed to improving the human rights situation. The High Commissioner remains gravely concerned that, 2 1/2 years into a reconciliation process, his Office continues to receive reports of harassment or surveillance of human rights defenders and victims of human rights violations. The preconditions of trust and confidence that are needed for a reconciliation agenda to succeed are incompatible with intrusive, and likely unnecessary, surveillance of activists. While the High Commissioner has repeatedly been assured that those incidents were not consistent with the Government\u2019s policy, the inability to fully eliminate such practices is alarming. During the period under review, at least two incidents escalated to physical violence against the activist being threatened or kept under surveillance. \u201cWhile the Government has managed to steer many of these worrying events in a positive direction, this type of violence in a country that has experienced cycles of extreme violence roughly every 10 years is deeply troubling, particularly when accompanied by hate speech, misinformation and agitation through social media and political manipulation. The continuing allegations of torture and surveillance and the lack of sufficient progress in implementing critical confidence-building measures, such as the release of land, the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the solution to the pending cases under the Act, have antagonized key constituencies that could be instrumental to the Government\u2019s reform efforts. The High Commissioner urges the Human Rights Council to continue to play a critical role in encouraging progress in accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka,\u201d he said noting that it also calls on Member States to explore other avenues, including the application of universal jurisdiction that could foster accountability.", "intro": "The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein criticizing Sri Lanka\u2019s judiciary system said the country was following a contradictory mechanism in issues concerning suspected state and military officers and asked international powers to take stern action on war crimes and human rights violations.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/7401-sri-lanka-s-courts-double-standards-un-human-rights-chief"},

Sri Lanka was subjected to its 1st Mutual Evaluation (ME) by APG in 2006 and the 2nd ME during 2014/15. The 2nd Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) on Sri Lanka which was adopted in July, 2015, recommended Sri Lanka to initiate a number of actions to rectify the AML/CFT deficiencies identified during the ME. Subsequently, Sri Lanka implemented a series of measures to address the deficiencies including adoption of National AML/CFT Policy, issuance of Customer Due Diligence Rules for Financial institutions and introduction of risk-based AML/CFT Supervision for financial institutions. At the same time institution-wise action plan to rectify the deficiencies highlighted in the ME was adopted with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. Based on the progress made, APG upgraded further 9 Recommendations, initially rated as partially compliant to largely compliant level, bringing the total number of compliant/largely compliant Recommendations to 21. In October 2016, the FATF informed that Sri Lanka will be subject to a review of the International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG) of the FATF to assess the progress of AML/CFT effectiveness. After several discussions and progress reports, the FATF informed that Sri Lanka has not made sufficient progress in 4 areas, namely International Cooperation, Supervision, Legal Persons and Arrangements and Targeted Financial Sanctions on Proliferations (North Korea& Iran). As a result, the FATF at its Plenary held at Buenos Aires, Argentina in October 2017, listed Sri Lanka as a jurisdiction with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies in the FATF\u2019s Compliance Document which is more commonly identified as \u201cthe Grey List\u201d. Upon listing, a time bound action plan to address the strategic deficiencies identified was provided to Sri Lanka. Since the listing in November 2017, Sri Lankan authorities have taken a number of measures to enhance AML/CFT compliance such as issue of Customer Due Diligence Rule No 1 of 2018 for Designated Non-Finance Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs), issuance of regulation for North Korea on targeted financial sanctions on proliferations. Further, several initiatives are being taken by Sri Lanka including, introducing amendments to the Trust ordinance & Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act No 25 of 2002 by the Ministry of Justice, introducing amendments to the Companies Act No 7 of 2007 by the Registrar of Companies, issuance and implementation of regulation on proliferation targeted financial sanctions on Iran by Ministry of Foreign Affairs, implementation of regulation issued on North Korea by the Competent Authority (Ministry of Defence) and introduction of risked based AML/CFT supervision for Designated Non Finance Businesses and Professions by the Financial Intelligence Unit. In addition, measures have been taken to strengthen AML/CFT supervision of the Financial Intelligence Unit by allocating more competent staff to the existing team of supervisors. Considering the scope of the action plan set out by FATF, a sound framework is now in place by the National Coordinating Committee the AML/CFT Policy setting body of the FIU to bring the commitment and coordination of all the stakeholders in the country to enhance the AML/CFT Standards.

One such local travel company has given credit amounting to US$ 2 million to a Chinese travel agent and is now in serious financial trouble, he said adding that the accumulated credit of some of these local tour operators under this set up would be more than $10 million easily.   \u201cWorking with Chinese agents has a credit risk at large. Ideal scenario is to recover the full payment in advance or 60-80 percent prior to the tour\u201d, SLAITO observed.    If credit is extended, it should be given after a thorough back ground check, he pointed out adding that generally majority of Chinese agents will request credit for 60-90 days.   However when credit is extended a very close tab on payments is needed on the business handled and future business as well, he suggested.    Each company will have to carry out their own back ground checks on Chinese agents and extend credit accordingly, SLAITO emphasised.    Businesses are run individually and each company has to check credit worthiness and manage the incoming business and payments receivables with a very close control of outstanding payments, SLAITO said noting that it should not be allowed to go beyond the extended credit limit strictly.   Most of the Sri Lankan companies have used different methods to recover debt payments by complaining to the Sri Lanka Embassy in Beijing and with the help of, third party payment recovery units operating in China.

This is the 21st century, not the 15th. Women must have rights as equal to men. If the president sees fit for women to not receive liquor then he must pass a law to ensure the same for men. After all, a president shouldn't be one who sees things in a sexist way. The president needs to see things from the standpoint of equality. He must make sure that all genders receive the same. It is hard to think that as a country in the 21st century that such a law was even discussed. That there are still people who believe themselves to be superior because of their gender identification. The reasoning for the matter was stated as \"women need to wake up early to cook breakfast but how will they do it if they aren't sober enough?\" It has been proven that women have more self control than men as they are taught many responsibilities as children. Other than that fact, one should learn how to cook for themselves no matter what gender because one's sexism nor feminism will help you when you are starving. Liquor is injurious to health and because of that I believe that this law should apply for all genders, but that aside I don't believe that it should be applied to only one gender because of your sexism. This country has many types of issues. The ones regarding sexism are so subtle that even women support them. This shows how the small issues that go unnoticed can cause bigger problems. Girls from a young age are taught that everything they do in life is all to find a suitable man to marry and please. Girls are taught that men should be glorified and should be respected even when they (women) are being disrespected by men. From a young age girls are locked up like prizes to be won, restricted from doing simple things until one day they marry. But by then they don't know how to be self dependant, don't know that their life has much more than a man so they live their lives a slave to home. Sexism comes in many forms. Telling girls to not go outside after 6 pm, teaching men that it's acceptable for them to not respect women. Showing men that women are nothing but objects, girls being taught to only listen. And right now it is shown by telling women that they can't drink but men can. It is unfortunate to call our country a developing country when we only want to develop our economy but not our morals. - Nethmi Kumarapperuma", "intro": "It was unfortunate for me, a 16 year old girl to hear about the new law passed by the president of Sri Lanka which deemed that women are not allowed to purchase nor sell liquor as it was unfit for them to do so.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/6877-gendering-liquor"},

The draft Annual accounts for the years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 are currently being examined by the Auditor General and final reports with opinion are expected shortly.

Its tasks include ensuring the implementation of the Agreement; setting mutually agreed priorities; and making constructive recommendations. The Commission accordingly deals with a broad range of bilateral and multilateral issues of mutual interest to the EU and Sri Lanka. The Working Group on Governance, Rule of Law, and Human Rights, the Working Group on Trade and Economic Cooperation Issues, and the Working Group on Development Cooperation\u2013established under the terms of the Joint Commission\u2013held meetings in the last year. Each Working Group reported back to the Joint Commission on their respective meetings. The 21st meeting of the Joint Commission was held in an open and constructive spirit. The EU and Sri Lanka welcomed the formal restoration of the GSP Plus regime to Sri Lanka in May 2017, providing duty free access for more than 80% of Sri Lankan exports to the European Union, the world's largest economy, and Sri Lanka's largest export market. Sri Lanka stated that initial indications showed that the restoration of GSP Plus had contributed to a near doubling of export growth. The trade preferences scheme was restored in recognition of the progress made by Sri Lanka in implementing the 27 international conventions listed in the GSP Regulation relating to human rights, labour, good governance and the environment. The parties welcomed Sri Lanka\u2019s recent accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, but there was agreement that the Government of Sri Lanka must ensure that the policy of zero-tolerance for the use of torture is implemented and that perpetrators are swiftly brought to justice. The EU re-emphasised its clear and unwavering expectation that urgent action would be taken by the Sri Lankan authorities to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and replace it with legislation that is in line with international standards. Plans to resolve as soon as possible the situation of the remaining detainees held under the PTA were discussed. In addition, there was discussion of the need to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure to ensure fundamental legal safeguards. The EU and Sri Lanka remain committed to continuing bilateral discussions through the respective Working Groups and the GSP+ monitoring process with a view to further strengthening the implementation of the provisions of the 27 conventions. The accession to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, and adoption of a National Human Rights Action Plan, as well as the acceptance of the vast majority of recommendations received during the third cycle of its Universal Periodic Review in November 2017, were welcomed by both parties as evidence of Sri Lanka\u2019s continued commitment to reform. The meeting also provided an opportunity to exchange views on the implementation of the UN Human Rights Council Resolutions of 1 October 2015 and 23 March 2017. The parties noted the progress made with respect to the establishment of the Office on Missing Persons. They also noted Sri Lanka\u2019s reaffirmed commitment to establishing the remaining mechanisms aimed at truth seeking, reconciliation, reparation, and justice, on which the EU urged for prompt action. Progress with regard to the enactment of the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Act, unmet expectations of justice in the 'emblematic cases', the further release of land, and the normalisation of civilian life in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka, were discussed during the meeting. Sri Lanka also provided updates on the ongoing constitutional reform process, and measures to combat corruption. Sri Lanka welcomed the EU's support in rural development and the widening of development cooperation to include support to democratic governance and reconciliation. The EU continues to be one of largest grant donors to Sri Lanka, with an allocation of \u20ac210 million (approximately LKR 40 billion) for the period 2014-2020, and last year launched its largest programme of cooperation to improve the lives of poor people living in the rural areas of Central and Uva Provinces.

A spokesman told the BBC that all the countries affected had been informed, in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa. The UK, US and Australia were not affected, he added. The Lactalis group is one of the world's largest producers of dairy products, with annual sales of \u20ac17bn ($21bn; \u00a315bn), It has 246 production sites in 47 countries and employs 15,000 people in France alone.

Preventing women from consuming alcohol, selling alcohol and purchasing alcohol from liquor shops are restrictions put on ourselves. However, if such a law existed, this is an utter joke. Women who want to consume alcohol on various social levels, do so. The elite women consume alcohol in big hotels while the poor folk who engage in hard labour consume alcohol either at local taverns or liquor spots. This has been happening in a usual manner. All this time no one spoke against it. The Finance Minister too knew this when he issued the gazette notification to lift the ban. Therefore one wonders if this is just another method of trying to stir up society with regard to women consuming alcohol. I respect the Finance Minister and consider him a knowledgeable man on social issues. But before lifting such bans he must have been aware that there was such a rule. Our women did consume alcohol in the past, they still do and they will continue to do so even in the future. But by lifting this ban if anyone is of the view that women will start drinking and coming home drunk, then that is a wrong notion. But, our women today have taken on the burden of their families and they are aware of their responsibilities. A responsible woman knows where she has to go and just because the laws and relaxed women who love and care for their families will not start drinking and coming home drunk, shirking their responsibility. Just because they are allowed to drink if one thinks that society will be turned upside down, then they are very wrong.

The statement reads, Today, January 8th, 2018, marks the ninth anniversary of one of the most heinous crimes ever committed against Sri Lanka\u2019s constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression. It was nine years ago, today, at 10:45 AM that I received the news that Lasantha Wickrematunge, the fearless editor of The Sunday Leader, and my dear friend, had been ambushed and attacked as he drove to work. A few hours later when Lasantha succumbed to his injuries, Sri Lanka lost one of the most enigmatic and courageous journalists that the world had ever known. In the aftermath of this cowardly assassination, the media, legal fraternity, civil society and the political opposition parties joined together as one, demanding justice for Lasantha by way of a thorough and impartial investigation and condemning those who gave aid, comfort and shelter to his killers. For six years, we struggled in vain, until on January 8, 2015, the people of Sri Lanka threw out the Rajapakse regime and placed their faith in the Unity government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe. Our moral and civic duty to demand justice for Lasantha has been replaced with the responsibility for delivering that justice, by enabling and ensuring a thorough and impeccably independent police investigation, led by the officers of the Criminal Investigation Department. This investigation has already exposed the intricacy of the measures taken by the previous regime to cover up the murder. From the false cause-of-death in the original post-mortem report to the irregular transfer of the investigation away from the CID, and the death of a key witness-turned-suspect in custody, it is clear that no stone was left unturned. Despite these and whatever obstacles come before us, this government is committed to providing the CID and the Attorney General\u2019s Department with whatever resources and support they require to indict and convict those who committed, aided and instigated Lasantha\u2019s murder. Failure is unacceptable.

It is stated that senior officials of the Central Bank were inactive before the former Governor of Central Bank, Arjuna Mahendran. It is believed that because they had not questioned about these and had become inactive, such incorrect decisions were made. Mr Mahendran has made interference into bond auctions through a system of incorrect and unconventional methods and he was responsible for providing internal information to outsiders. One party has used such information to obtain undue monetary profits. The Commission has stated that the Attorney General and the Bribery or Corruption Commission must take the legal actions to implement the recommendations of the Commission. Under normal circumstances, recovery of money is done through civil legal action. However, it is a time consuming method.

May the Triple Gem Bless You First of all, I offer my best wishes for the New Year. As the people of the country are very eagerly waiting with high interest, I wish to make a statement on the final report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into the Bond Issuance of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, which was appointed by me taking into considerations the opinion of the people regarding allegations of corrupt practices and misdeed during the period 2015 and 2016. This report was handed over to me on December 30, 2017. The Commission was mandated to inquire into the period from 1st February 2015 to 31st March 2016 to find out actual facts and to make recommendation with regard to the steps to be implemented in the future. I thank the Supreme Court Judges and former Auditor General who functioned as members of the Commission and its Secretary and the staff, and those who assisted the work of the Commission, Attorney Generals Department, Police Department and other relevant organizations and individuals. The Commission is of the opinion that similar incidents as revealed in the Commission Report had happened even in 2008. The Commission recommends that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka should first conduct a forensic audit with regard to the alleged fraud and corrupt practices from 2008 and based on such findings legal steps should be taken. Commission states that funds of the Employment Provident Fund (EPF) were lost mostly during that period. The Commission has submitted a full report covering the period 2015 and 2016, comprising 1257 pages and it is not an interim report. The Commission has taken 10 months for this task. I have already submitted this report to the Attorney General and the Commission recommends that the criminal and civil court action must be taken through the Criminal Investigations Department and the Bribery or Corruption Commission. The Commission has clearly stated the structure of the Central Bank, Public Debt Department, direct issuance of bonds and the pros and cons of the system of bond issues and bond auctions. The report stated that the Perpetual Treasuries Limited has made profits through illegal means with the involvement of Mr Arjuna Mahendran, Bank officials and some outside individuals. In the auction held on 27th February 2015 alone the Perpetual Treasuries Limited has made a minimum benefit of over Rs 688 million. The Commission is of the opinion that further investigations could reveal that this amount could even be more than that. As revealed during the investigations Perpetual Treasuries Limited has made undue profit of Rs 11,145 millions in the secondary market. In this Employees Provident Fund and other government institutions had lost more than Rs 8,524 million or Rs 8.5 billion. It is stated that senior officials of the Central Bank were inactive before the former Governor of Central Bank, Arjuna Mahendran. It is believed that because they had not questioned about these and had become inactive, such incorrect decisions were made. Mr Mahendran has made interference into bond auctions through a system of incorrect and unconventional methods and he was responsible for providing internal information to outsiders. One party has used such information to obtain undue monetary profits. The Commission report said that the honorable Prime Minister\u2019s responsibility in the appointment of Mr. Arjuna Mahendren as the governor to the Central Bank was proper. The Commission is of the opinion that the Prime Minister made his statement in Parliament regarding the appointment of Mr Mahendran believing in the facts presented by Mr. Mahendran and Mr.Samarasiri, especially the promises made by Mr Mahendran. The Report also says that the Prime Minister should not have done that. The Commission stated that moreover these facts were before the COPE committee and the Prime Minister had not stated that because of that he had not taken the proper action against Mr. Mahendern. The Commission report refers to the allegation against former Finance Minister Mr Ravi Karunanayake regarding the payment of rent for the penthouse apartment belongs to the Aloysius Family and their Walt and Rowe Company and stated that Mr Karunanayake was responsible for that and recommended that the government should to take necessary action against Mr. Ravi Karunanayake under the section of bribery and corruption and further legal action under the penal codes for giving false evidence at the Commission. The Commission stated to the misuse of funds of the Employees Provident Fund and stated that EPF should be investigated under the forensic audit examination to find out the amount of losses. The repot has recognized that, the dishonesty of a particular party had lead to this kind of malpractice on EPF funds. The people responsible for these frauds have been identified and the Commission recommends legal action against them. The report recommends that, the legal action against relevant persons and officials who are responsible for the fraud including Perpetual Treasuries Limited, Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palihena should be taken. Accordingly, the government is in consultation with the legal authorities. Recommendation *Considering the recommendations of the Commission, the government recommends adapting a new Monetary Law Act in order to avoid this kind of malpractices in the Central Bank in future. The existing legal provisions are old and need replacement. *It is also recommended that the Registered Share Market Act must be replaced by a new legal act. *Members of Monetary Board and Central Bank Governor must be appointed by the Constitutional Council in concurrence of the members. The regulations must be amended accordingly. *The report recommends that there should be utmost supervision over the State Credit Department. As auditing at the Central Bank has not been conducted in a proper manner, the Commission recommended that the Audit Department must be reconstituted completely. A Legal Department must be established in the Central Bank and ensure that the Legal Department functions efficiently. *As the Commission did not have the mandate to inquire into treasury bond issues from 2008 to 2015, the Commission had not done that. However, Commission recommends that there should be an investigation into that period too. *The Commission recommends that the dealings with the Pan Asia Bank and the conduct of Chairman must be investigated unto. *The recommends that activities of the EPF must be looked into and in order to bring the ETF into a proper order, steps must be taken to restructure the ETF. *A code of conduct for the officials of the Central Bank must be introduced. The code of conduct for Primary Dealers must be revised and updated. *The Commission has stated that the Attorney General and the Bribery or Corruption Commission must take the legal actions to implement the recommendations of the Commission. *Under normal circumstances, recovery of money is done through civil legal action. However, it is a time consuming method. As an alternative, the Commission recommend that a Parliamentary Legislation could be passed and the money could be recovered in a speedy manner through a Parliamentary procedure. We agree to that recommendation. *The recommendation of te Commission is that all the expenditure occurred for the Commission must be recovered from the Perpetual Treasuries Limited. *I have already submitted a copy of the Commission Report to the Attorney General and he will identify the persons against who the legal action must be taken and initiate necessary criminal or civil legal action to implement the recommendations of the Commission. *I wish to clarify here, that a minor amendment to the Bribery or Corruption Commission Act must be enacted to take legal action on the recommendations of the Commission. For this purpose, already experts at the legal draughtsman are working on the required amendment. *The steps needed to make Bribery or Corruption Commission more active and efficient should have been done long time ago, and now we are taking required steps for that purpose. The confidentiality, astuteness and auditing methods of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka were extremely weak. There were no tele-recording systems, electronic monitoring or even CCTVs. The current Governor of the Central bank has already taken steps to remove weaknesses and rectify these errors. The Governor has informed that he has suspended some employees of the Central Bank after their malpractices were revealed in the investigations in the Commission and disciplinary actions are being taken against those officers. I expect the Governor to make a statement in the near future regarding the shortcomings in the Central bank as revealed in the Commission Report. I urge the Justice Ministry and the Attorney General to take early steps to draft the three bills proposed by the Commission present them to Parliament, in order to make required changes at the Central Bank to ensure such corrupt practices, frauds and malpractices would not take place in the future. I have informed my Secretary to hold monthly review meetings with the heads of relevant departments and institutions to examine the progress in implementations of the recommendations of the Commission to take legal steps against those individuals and take other required steps in an efficient and speedy manner. I would like to specifically state here that I would not hesitate to take steps to recover the loss of Rs 11,145 million and take legal action against the offenders and punish them. The sum of Rs 8529 million of the total losses Rs 11,145 million was the funds of the Employees Provident Fund, Mahapola Scholarship Fund, National Savings Bank and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation. The balance was from private institutions. Hence the loss to the public sector \u2013 EPF, Mahapola, NDB and SLIC was over Rs 8.5 billion. The Perpetual Treasuries Limited has made this profit of Rs 11,145 million within a short period of 5 months. Finally, especially I would like to mention that this final report must be presented to the Parliament and through this initiative the report must be open to the public. In the future, necessary as well as legal steps in this regard will be taken expeditiously according to the advice from the Attorney General. I kindly request to consider the openness of the facts of this Commission Report and I assure that any hesitation would not occur in filing cases against the offenders. Furthermore, I wish to state that this is the final report of the Commission. I have previously appointed a Commission and the report of that has been handed over to me. It is the final report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC). This Commission carried out their respective duties during the past two and half years. I extend my gratitude to the staff of the Commission and all the institutions including the Secretary and High Court judges for giving their support in this task. Already, 34 reports of that Commission had been handed over to me and recently 17 reports have been handed over and another 17 previously, the 17 reports handed over previously I have submitted to the Attorney General to take necessary actions through relevant institutions. By now, the Fraud and Corruption Commission, institutions, departments and Police have taken actions to file cases based on the facts of these reports. The report which was handed over to me before two days I will submit to Attorney General within this week to take appropriate actions. Especially I have to mention the actions on this report will be taken in the near future. The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges has presented several major facts and it is the responsibility of the Government to implement facts presented at the Commission. I will explain to you regarding those facts for the general public information. Training and appointment of suitable officials as there is lack for skilled well-trained officials to carry out investigation regarding fraud and corruptions. This Commission emphasized that people without required qualifications had been appointed and only the qualified persons should be appointed to essential positions including the State institutions, Authorities and Constitutional Boards. The Commission revealed that the money spent by the Government for the establishment of this Commission has already been recovered through the cases initiated through the findings of this Commission. A system must be implemented to hearing the cases in the courts in other areas as holding these cases only in Courts in Colombo is causing difficulties for those who travel from distances. I must states a special thing, before I conclude the facts of these two reports, I saw a great eagerness and inquiring trend among the general public regarding these Commissions. At the same time when the Commissions were appointed, especially before the appointment of the Bond Commission, some people commented, even in Parliament that nothing had happened to previous commissions and the same fate would happen to this commission too. They also said the intention of appointment of a commission was to cover up the wrong doings. But all of us must be very pleased regarding the fulfillment of duties of these Commissions and again I must thank the judges and all those who contributed in this regard for their great service rendered while wining the confidence of the general public. Finally, I must state regarding the allegations leveled against me by some political parties for appointing these Commissions. I never appointed these commissions targeting any political party. I must specially mention in future when the cases are filed in accordance with the investigations and the recommendations and information of these Commissions, individuals belongs to two main political parties will be among the defendants in the legal process. We must be happy over our independent and impartial Judiciary. I must state all of us will provide our maximum support for this process.

{"topic": "Elections, referendum and protests require active Tamil political participation", "full_news": "This article will look at three events expected to take place in the country in 2018 \u2013 local government elections in February, the adoption of a new constitution and protests by victims as they continue to demand the return of private land and for information about the disappeared \u2013 where participation will be vital if Tamils are to remain a viable factor in national politics. Local government elections have been announced for 10 February countrywide. Although local, they will be contested on national issues and large political questions. In the Sinhala-dominated South, it will be a referendum on the long-term viability of the incumbent national government. In the North and East, the results will show how far Tamils remain wedded to the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the largest Tamil party in parliament. The TNA also has an overwhelming majority in the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) and a significant number of seats in the Eastern Provincial Council. The main challenge to the TNA is from another collective of Tamil parties. The Eelam Peoples\u2019 Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) has broken away from the TNA to contest the election in a new alliance under the Tamil United Liberation Front\u2019s (TULF) party symbol. It is almost impossible that the new alliance will win a majority of seats in the local councils of the North and East. While it is yet to announce a programme of work and there are allegations that its constituent parties are working to New Delhi\u2019s wishes, its appeal lies in the party\u2019s leadership of TNA dissidents, while its platform denounces the TNA for compromising its electoral promises. The compromises are: ineffective accountability mechanisms for past human rights violations and an ineffectual political settlement through a new constitution, which goes against the party\u2019s election promises. Although the TULF is taking on the TNA at the forthcoming elections, it is important to note that other Tamil political formations in the recent past have displayed woeful political acumen. The Tamil People\u2019s Council (TPC) was formed under the leadership of NPC Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran, the EPRLF, the Tamil National People\u2019s Front (TNPF) and northern civil society organisations. However, other than holding very successful \u2018Eluga Thamil\u2019 rallies \u2013 one in Jaffna and another in Batticaloa \u2013 the TPC has done very little to rally behind important social and political causes of the day such as protests against military-held private land or the quest of families of the disappeared for truth and justice. There were also hiccups when the EPRLF split from the TNA and tried entering into an electoral alliance with TNPF which soon fell apart, before joining with the TULF. Why then should the Tamil people vote for such a party? There are at least three reasons. One: there is concern that multiple parties in the electoral arena will fragment the core set of Tamil demands. That is plain wrong. Obviously there were no united set of demands within the TNA; if not the EPRLF would not have split. Second, groups and individuals leaving established political parties representing the status quo is not necessarily political fragmentation. In this case at least, the TULF, in its new avatar, is hoping to plunge into active electoral politics. In other words the TNA will have a rival centre of power competing for votes, support and funds. And where democratic politics in North and East Sri Lanka is in right now, competition will be beneficial. Third, the February elections are for local councils. It will give the Tamil voters a chance to evaluate the capability of the new TULF before deciding to either support or ditch it at provincial or national elections. Tamils\u2019 political participation will also be of vital importance if the proposed new constitution sees the light of day. Although a new constitution being introduced depends primarily on the political calculations of the ruling coalition, it has been enthusiastically supported in this endeavour by the TNA. Two important documents have been drafted by parliamentary committees working with experts \u2013 the Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly of Sri Lanka and reports of six other sub-committees. Tamil commentators and interest groups reviewing these documents have said, the proposals are a gross violation of what the TNA told Tamil voters would form the elements of a political settlement. The Tamil Lawyers\u2019 Forum, an interest group said, \u201cHaving been elected \u2026 on the basis of campaigns which clearly stated that the North-East was the inseparable and indisputable homeland of the Tamils, the \u2026 TNA should not act against the people's mandate.\u201d The two reports are only proposals which the Constitutional Assembly, responsible for crafting the new constitution has the discretion to accept or not. According to laid out procedure, there will be no opportunities for the public to comment on the proposals before new constitution becomes basic law. Even if the public views compiled by the Report on Public Representations on Constitutional Reform are given due consideration, the fundamental question is: will the Constitutional Assembly dominated by Sinhala-Buddhist parliamentarians vote for a constitution for a federal, secular and ethnically neutral state? In other words, whether or not the TNA reaches a consensus with the government on constitutional proposals, as it has in the Interim Report, the fact is that the Sinhala-Buddhist majority\u2019s views will carry the Constitutional Assembly. If the new constitution passed by parliament does little to meet Tamils\u2019 aspirations, the TNA\u2019s messaging on it to the Tamil public will be of crucial importance. TNA\u2019s leader, also the Leader of the Opposition, R. Sampanthan, has stressed that following its adoption by parliament, the new constitution has to be ratified by the people at a referendum. While seemingly democratic and the instrument to forge a consensus in pluralistic Sri Lanka, realistically what chances do provisions favouring Tamils or Muslims stand in passing at a referendum where 70% of the ballots will be cast by Sinhala Buddhists? Assuming that the TNA votes for a constitution that only inadequately fulfils Tamil aspirations, where will this place the Tamils? A factor that has granted authenticity for Tamil opposition \u2013 both armed and nonviolent \u2013 has been the historic rejection by Tamil parties of both constitutions crafted in independent Sri Lanka. When the First Republican Constitution was being debated and the Constituent Assembly not only rejected the Tamil demand for federalism but even compromises for minimal power-sharing, the Federal Party withdrew in June 1971 and halted any further participation in the proceedings. When the Second Republican Constitution was adopted by the UNP government in 1978 and the TULF, then the largest Tamil party in the parliament did not participate because the then government refused accommodate its demands at the proposed round table conference. If the TNA agrees to vote with the government to signal reconciliation and goodwill, the only safeguard the Tamils will have to reject the new constitution and thereby continue to agitate for a freer, fairer and more equal state will be at a referendum. No doubt the numerical minority living in Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka will have minimal impact on a referendum that needs only 50% plus one vote to carry. But an important political statement will be made if a group that defines itself as a people and living in a territorially contiguous area rejects what becomes the basic law of the country. Finally, there are the public protests and civil disobedience campaigns carried out by the Tamil public to recover private land now occupied by the Sri Lanka military in Keppapilavu and Pilakudiyiruppu, and families of the disappeared for truth and justice for their missing loved ones. Protests erupted in early 2017 when victims finding both the Sri Lanka government and their elected representatives \u2013 TNA \u2013 unresponsive to their requests and resorted to direct action. Protests for land began on 31 January 2017 when landowners of Keppapilavu who had been promised by the military that their land would be returned were informed of a new delay. Inflamed that they were being double-crossed, the villagers pitched makeshift tents before a Sri Lanka Air Force camp and wowed not to return until they were allowed to resettle in their land. After almost a year of confrontation, the military has agreed to return 133 acres of the larger land it has occupied. The contours of the confrontation assumed many shapes and part of the settlement was the payment of at least Rupees 148 million to the military by the Ministry of Resettlement. Although at the time of writing there are still blocks for the families to resettle, it appears the remaining obstacles can be overcome. Although landowners have tried to cajole and humour the military into leaving Keppapilvu and other areas before, one important factor that turned the tide in this instance, was the constant presence of the victims and the relentless direct action they undertook. Similarly, families of the disappeared have been protesting in Kilinochchi and Mullaithivu from February asking for the information of their loved ones. Although their demands are yet to be met, their struggle has caught the eye of the international media and the international community. In his report on Sri Lanka at the UNHRC sessions in September this year UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zaid Hussein said \u201cIn the North, protests by victims indicate their growing frustration over the slow pace of reforms.\u201d Direct action by families of the disappeared was also able to force meetings with President Maithripala Sirisena in the past six months. Following the last meeting Kankaranjini Yogarasa a leader of the protests addressing the media said \u201cToday we lost faith that this government, which preaches Buddhist values, will give us back our children \u2026 but we will continue our unremitting struggle for our loved ones.\u201d As such, the families of the disappeared are campaigning for international intervention through the UN Human Rights Council pressing for the implementation of Resolution 30/1 and for an effective Office of Missing Persons and hybrid court with a robust international participation. In all three instances \u2013 putting together a viable opposition to the TNA at the local council elections, voting in a referendum if the new constitution is passed, and continuing protests for accountability and justice will need direct political participation of the Tamil people. It will most certainly meet opposition and possibly even violence, which nobody wishes for. But that is the path the current politics in North and East Sri Lanka is compelling the people to take.

{"topic": "Sri Lanka on \u2018Status of Jerusalem\u2019 vote", "full_news": "The statement says, Sri Lanka voted in favour of the resolution titled \u2018Status of Jerusalem\u2019 submitted by Yemen and Turkey in their capacity as Chair of the Arab Group and Chair of the Summit of the Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation, respectively, at the tenth emergency special session of the UN General Assembly, on 21 December 2017. This vote in favour of the resolution was on the basis of Sri Lanka\u2019s long held traditional and principled position, which is in keeping with the international understanding that Jerusalem is a final-status issue that must be resolved through negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both parties \u2013 Palestinians and Israelis, and that Jerusalem should be the shared capital of the Israeli and Palestinian States. The resolution adopted at the tenth emergency special session of the UN General Assembly on 21 December 2017 reaffirms this position, and Sri Lanka\u2019s vote in favour of the resolution was not a vote against any member State of the United Nations. Sri Lanka stands by its position that it is only by realizing the vision of two States living side-by-side in peace, security and mutual recognition, with Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Palestine, with all matters resolved permanently through negotiations, that the legitimate aspirations of both parties and sustainable peace can be achieved. Therefore, Sri Lanka strongly believes that all parties concerned should work with restraint, and focus on creating conditions for direct and meaningful negotiations that can resolve all final status issues required for a negotiated settlement. The BBC filed the following story titled \u2018Jerusalem: UN resolution rejects Trump's declaration: The UN General Assembly has decisively backed a resolution effectively calling on the US to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The text says that any decisions regarding the status of the city are \"null and void\" and must be cancelled. The non-binding resolution was approved by 128 states, with 35 abstaining and nine others voting against. It came after US President Donald Trump threatened to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. Following the vote, state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the US was exploring \"various options\" and no decisions had yet been made. The nine who voted against the resolution were the US, Israel, Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo  Among the 35 abstaining were Canada and Mexico  Those voting in favour included the other four permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia and the UK) as well as key US allies in the Muslim world  There were 21 countries who did not turn up for the vote. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. Israel occupied the east of the city in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. The 193-member UN General Assembly held the rare emergency special session at the request of Arab and Muslim states, who condemned Mr Trump's decision to reverse decades of US policy earlier this month. The Palestinians called for the meeting after the US vetoed a Security Council resolution that was similar to the text approved on Thursday. The text put forward by Turkey and Yemen does not mention the US, but expresses \"deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem\". It also says \"any decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council\". Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised to reject the results of the vote, calling the UN a \"house of lies\". Afterwards he said in a statement: \"Israel thanks President Trump for his unequivocal position in favour of Jerusalem and thanks those countries that voted alongside Israel, alongside the truth.\" A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the vote \"a victory for Palestine\". In a speech before the vote, US permanent representative Nikki Haley stressed that the US decision did not prejudge any final status issues, and did not preclude a two-state solution if the parties agreed to that. \"The United States will remember this day, on which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation,\" she said. \"America will put our embassy in Jerusalem. That is what the American people want us to do. And it is the right thing to do. No vote in the United Nations will make any difference on that.\" On Wednesday, Mr Trump warned he might cut financial aid to states who voted in favour of the resolution. \"They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us,\" he said. \"Well, we're watching those votes,\" he added. \"Let them vote against us. We'll save a lot. We don't care.\" \u00a0", "intro": "Sri Lanka's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a statement in response to media queries on the Resolution on the \u2018Status of Jerusalem\u2019 adopted at the tenth emergency special session of the UN General Assembly on 21 December 2017.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/6374-sri-lanka-on-status-of-jerusalem-vote"},

{"topic": "Sri Lankan man 'risks torture and rape' if deported", "full_news": "The Geneva-based committee of 10 independent human rights experts has issued an interim measure formally requesting Australia not to return the man while his case is considered. The man, whom the Guardian has chosen to refer to as Jyran, was told on 6 December by the department of immigration to prepare to be deported imminently from Australia. Jyran faces arrest in Sri Lanka over his alleged links to the defeated separatist army the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam \u2013 the Tamil Tigers. He is not alleged to have been a fighter: his arrest warrant states he faces charges of \u201cassisting anti-government activities and supporting and assisting a terrorist organisation\u201d. The Tamil Tigers were ultimately defeated in 2009 after 26 years of brutal civil war. The asylum seeker, an ethnic Tamil, went through Australia\u2019s controversial \u201cfast-track\u201d refugee status determination process and was found to not meet the criteria for refugee status. Under the fast-track system, no additional information can be brought after an initial protection application. Jyran did not present the arrest warrant in the first instance, later explaining he did not understand the Australian justice system and feared he would   because of it. Having failed to produce the warrant, his protection claim was dismissed as not credible, and the Immigration Assessment Authority, which reviewed his case, chose not to consider the document after being presented with it. But the UN committee heard that Jyran faced \u201cstate-sanctioned torture\u201d if he were to be refouled.  Jyran\u2019s lawyer, Alison Battisson, told the committee. There has been widespread reportage of the mistreatment and torture of prisoners by Sri Lankan security forces, including the systematic use of rape. In July this year the UN\u2019s special rapporteur Ben Emmerson visited Sri Lanka and reported that \u201cthe use of torture, has been, and remains today, endemic and routine, for those arrested and detained on national security grounds\u201d.  Emmerson wrote. Arrest warrants over alleged links to the Tamil Tigers are often seen as highly politicised or based on limited, or no, evidence. Battisson, the director of Human Rights for All, said the committee\u2019s interim measure highlighted the serious issues faced by Tamil asylum seekers facing forcible return from Australia. \u201d Battisson said she was relieved the committee against torture had chosen to act, and quickly, to prevent the potential refoulement of Jyran. \u201cThese interim measures are quite rare \u2013 this illustrates the very real concern the UN has over Australia\u2019s practices of refouling Tamils to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is not safe for many Tamils to return to.\u201d A spokesperson from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection told the Guardian that people with no lawful basis to remain in Australia were expected to return home. \u201cAustralia does not remove people to Sri Lanka who engage Australia\u2019s non\u2011refoulement obligations.

{"topic": "Report questions UN peacekeepers from Sri Lanka (video)", "full_news": "The International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) and Journalists for Democracy (JDS) in Sri Lanka say in the report that Sri Lanka has yet to hold any of its 134 peacekeepers against whom a UN inquiry found prima facie evidence of child sexual exploitation in Haiti a decade ago, accountable. In its 2016 submission to the UN, Sri Lanka further states that a military court of inquiry was set up to investigate allegations against some members of the 6th contingent deployed to Haiti, says the report posted on the itjpsl.com website. This is problematic because the OIOS (UN\u2019s Office of Internal Oversight Services) inquiry report makes it clear the violations didn\u2019t just start in 2007, they had been going on since 2004 from the arrival of the first contingent of Sri Lankans in Haiti. It appears that only one contingent was disciplined by Sri Lanka, not six. There is also the responsibility of the Contingent commander to discipline his men. The OIOS report says there were \u201cclear indications of red flags\u201d of sexual exploitation and abuse at the Sri Lankan bases but the Sri Lankan commanders failed to take action. Of the 10 officers convicted, the Government says one had his commission withdrawn, one was retired and eight were given punishments \u201cbased on the gravity of the offences committed\u201d. Given the allegation was child sexual exploitation it\u2019s hard to understand how any punishment without jail time fits the crime. The Government said it had established a military court of inquiry. But in a November 2017 article, the High Commissioner to Canada, Ahmed A. Jawad, said there were two courts of inquiry conducted by the Sri Lankan army and the navy respectively. Sri Lanka\u2019s submission to the UN states that in June 2015 the UN Secretariat noted the outcome of its military court process and confirmed the matter closed. Sri Lanka\u2019s Hugh Commissioner to Canada later said that the UN Secretariat wrote to the Government to say that as of 29 September 2014 it considered the matter closed. It\u2019s not clear why different dates are given. No statement has been issued by the UN to contradict the Sri Lankan assertion that the issue is closed. This seems extraordinary the lack of criminal accountability for what is organised child sexual exploitation committed over many years by multiple contingents in the face of the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy on sexual exploitation and abuse advocated by the Secretary General. The report tells the United Nations, DPKO, OHCHR to disclose what action was taken in ensuring that Sri Lanka complied with their obligations in terms of the 134 soldiers repatriated and the UN OIOS Inquiry to ensure accountability. It also wants the disclosure of the standards and criteria utilised by DPKO to ensure that sexual predators and paedophiles are not allowed into peacekeeping troops i.e. is there now a register of those implicated in such crimes across the world?

The Working Group also commended the constructive cooperation of the Government of Sri Lanka with the international community, in particular the United Nations Human Rights Mechanisms. The visit of the Working Group and the recent visits of other UN Special Procedures are a clear example of such engagement.

They said that current powers to deprive individuals of their liberty extended across a range of facilities, including police stations, prisons, open work camps, centres for juveniles and the elderly, mental health institutions and rehabilitation camps for former combatants, as well as those for drug addicts and people in vulnerable situations. The experts called for urgent reforms to address problems including the excessive use of remand, a lack of effective alternatives to detention, an outdated legal framework and reliance on confessions, often extracted under torture or duress.

Ltd without calling for tenders raises suspicion that a certain financial irregularity could be behind this deal. These sources said that at the time the tenders were called, De La Rue Lanka Currency & Security Print (Pvt.) Ltd had not presented a tender for the supply of digital passports. Meanwhile, according to a report issued by the Government Printing Department, the printing of the digital passports could be done at a cost of Rs. 600 million, but disregarding this proposal Cabinet approval had been granted to De La Rue Lanka Currency & Security Print (Pvt.) Ltd the contract to print the digital passports, which is questionable. On a previous occasion when Cabinet approval was sought to grant the contract to print the digital passports to De La Rue Lanka Currency & Security Print (Pvt.) Ltd, the President in his observations had pointed out that instead of giving the contract to a single company, tenders should be called in a competitive bidding process. \u00a0However, despite the President\u2019s advice, several government members had pursued their endeavour to grant the contract to this company, and as a result an MoU was signed with ICTA and De La Rue Lanka Currency & Security Print (Pvt.) Ltd on June 13, 2017, to implement the process of preparing the electronic passports and study the technical requirements. Later, disregarding the President\u2019s observations and Cabinet decision the MoU was signed and on August 09, 2017, a joint Cabinet paper no. 17/2522/749/022 was presented to the Cabinet by the Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando and Minister S.B. Navinna who is the subject Minister for the Immigration and Emigration Department. However at the time the Cabinet advice was to launch the project according to the \u201cSwiss Challenge\u201d system instead of giving the contract to a single company. According to reports, however, De La Rue Lanka Currency & Security Print (Pvt.) Ltd had not been agreeable to this proposal. Further it is also reported that the British High Commissioner too had notified several government bigwigs to grant the contact to De La Rue Lanka Currency & Security Print (Pvt.) Ltd. Therefore the Cabinet paper no. 17/2522/749/022 was presented by Minister Harin Fernando on November 02 and accordingly, it was requested to amend the recommendations of the Cabinet paper presented on August 09, 2017 to grant the contract without calling for tenders, government internal sources revealed. However, these sources pointed out the De La Rue Lanka Currency & Security Print (Pvt.) Ltd is a British shareholding company and the eminent danger in exposing the whole process to an entirely private company. Further, there is also a situation where, by granting this contract to this company, over 400 employees that were recruited to the newly established passport office unit of the Immigration and Emigration Department, could lose their jobs.

Therefore, the \u201cSanghamith Diyani Foundation\u201d charged that this situation has arisen as a result of the male dominancy within the Buddha Sasana and their male counterpart acting in a selfish and jealous manner to obtain status and benefits just for themselves. The foundation alleges that at an earlier instance, when this issue was raised at the Buddha Sasana Ministry, the Monks had manipulated the department officials and obstructed justice being served to the Bikkhuni order. However. Prior to 2004, IDs for Bikkhuni\u2019s were issued without any hassle but it was refused for the ordained female monks.

Sri Lanka\u2019s government has introduced a tax on mobile phone towers to discourage their proliferation Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said adding that mushrooming of telecom towers is an environmental and health hazard as well. Telecom companies continue their operations in Sri Lanka ; and more new towers have started mushrooming throughout the country raising the number of towers to 5000, Mobile operators in Sri Lanka have resorted to undertake the sharing of towers and land as well as network elements as a precaution for the high cost of infrastructure investments, he said. Although Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) has introduced national policy and guidelines on telecom towers, some of the service providers have failed adhere to those guidelines and international standards, he disclosed. According to guidelines of this policy, only one tower is permitted within a radius of 500 metres. This guideline is not strictly adhered to by service providers. In some instances, the towers are susceptible for lightning strikes due to the failure to fix lightning protectors and proper system of earthen it due to high costs, thus exposing residents in the area to high risk, he added. This was another reason for the government\u2019s action to reduce the number of towers by imposing a high levy, he said. The tower levy is unlikely to result in the quick consolidation of antennae to fewer towers because tower sharing is already happening and in most cases, mounting additional antennae on existing towers is not practically possible because of the weight they (or the underlying structures) have been designed to carry. The likely outcome is the shutting down of marginal towers, harming the quality of service in the cities and loss of service in some rural areas.  Fixing additional antennas on existing towers could be carried out to a certain extent as the frame work of telecom towers cannot bear a heavy beyond the stipulated weight limit, Some towers will have to shut down affecting the quality of service in major towns and halt mobile service operations in rural areas, he predicted. In 2016 budget, a proposal was made to impose a similar tax of Rs.50, 000 per telecom tower and it has not exerted a major impact so far on the credit profile of major telecom companies SLT and Dialog,  Another proposal in the same budget was to form a company under a PPP to own and manage their own telecom towers in order to reduce operation costs as asset sharing has not been materialised up to now.", "intro": "Sri Lanka\u2019s telecom companies are compelled to absorb the Rs.200,000 mobile tower levy imposed in the 2018 budget .The government\u2019s aim of introducing this levy is to reduce the number of new towers mushrooming and proliferating countrywide, mobile operators said.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/6008-telcos-to-absorb-telecom-tower-levy"},

{"topic": "Palm oil fraudsters in trouble by the budget!", "full_news": "The scam had been taking place by obtaining approximately Rs. 25.00 tax rebate on a kilo of imported unrefined palm oil. Some unscrupulous importers have been showing that they were importing unrefined palm oil by missing acid oil into the palm oil in order to get the tax concession. By missing the acid oil these traders had intended to hoodwink the Sri Lanka Quality Standards Institute to indicate it was unrefined based on the \u20181% standard\u2019, but this palm oil had only shifted two decimal points in the SLS \u20181% standard\u2019 certification. However, although the Customs Department attempted several times to take action against these importers, as the SLS indicators were showing a 2% difference in its contents, the customs could not take legal action against them. Based on the reports received, these unscrupulous importers had been enjoying this tax concession and engaging in their illegal import, by the million in bribes paid to certain politicians. It is thus reported that the country has been deprived of millions of rupees in taxes annually by this cheating. However, through the Budget 2018, the tax concession on imported unrefined palm oil has been reduced from Rs. 25 to Rs. 15. Meanwhile the palm oil importing companies that import it legitimately have thanked the Finance Minister for reducing the tax concession that would allow them a better chance at competing against these unscrupulous importers.

The AG questioned him. This is the difference between the current good governance and the previous evil governance. The AG at the time, Mohan Peiris was put to a state where he was practically washing pots and pans at Medamoolana Walawwa. He was like a waiter at Medamoolana.

{"topic": "2018 budget proposals promote luxury cars", "full_news": "However, unexpectedly for the taxation of the vehicles the new budget had opened avenues for super luxury vehicles to flow in (which has high CIF value and high end options) at the same tax level as a mid-segment model, with the ad-valorem rate taken out. For some reason it seems that the regulators have missed the fact that a high cubic capacity engine will not necessarily represent high end vehicle but the determining factor is the output of an engine, motor traders said. The government had failed to understand the modern day auto mobile world and new trends in the trade worldwide. For example the comparison of a vehicle (apart from its options) is made taking in to consideration the power factor (Output) and the cost of producing it and not the cubic capacity of an engine. It is not fair to charge the same duty for a 2,000cc Korean made vehicle produced and purchased for 20,000 US$ and a European manufactured one purchased at 35,000 US$. In a real world scenario a European made model X with a CIF value of Rs.5 million (Taxed at 130%) will pay the same duty of a Japanese made model X with a CIF value of Rs.2.0 million (Taxed at 300%) thus depriving the government of a duty income of around Rs.7-10 million per vehicle. Further the additional outflow of foreign exchange on an expensive vehicle does not bring in sufficient proportion of inflow to the Government Revenue. Basically, the new policy whilst trying to close the front door had opened the rear door for outflow. However, under the current tax structure the market had created a non-level playing field allowing super luxury vehicles to flow in without understanding the true implications of such a policy. This policy in one way is depriving the duty payable to the government for high CIF vehicles. Over a period of one year this could record billions of rupees in tax loss, motor traders pointed out. Therefore, for a fair and justifiable system of duty calculations, motor traders suggest that the system has to be also linked to the engine output (BHP) so that the higher end super luxury vehicles will pay a higher duty closing tax revenue leakage to the government as well as creating a level playing field and ensuring the survival of all players in the market.", "intro": "The 2018 budget has paved the way for a balanced taxation mechanism for vehicle imports to a certain extent some of these areas with a long term perspective in mind such as the introduction of the new safety standards and emission regulations.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/5963-2018-budget-proposals-promote-luxury-cars"},

{"topic": "Liberalization will help Sri Lanka reach maritime hub status", "full_news": "The port played a significant role in the development of maritime hubs such as Singapore, helping the country become a first world economy in a generation. With the right reforms, Sri Lanka\u2019s ports could do the same, Advocata Institute has stated. Noting that Singapore\u2019s domestic market is small, but its trade volumes massive (trade value is 3.5X its GDP), Advocata states that transhipments make up 85% of Singapore\u2019s port\u2019s volumes; Sri Lanka has 750 local shipping, freight forwarding and clearing agents but Singapore open market has over 5,000. It says the availability of frequent and reliable connections via sea and air (thanks to liberalisation) encourages companies across the logistics chain to operate from Singapore. High-frequency connections sometimes allow goods to reach their destination faster via Singapore than they would through direct shipments. \u00a0A foreigner-friendly regulatory environment has attracted investors to Singapore, asserts Advocata Institute. \u201cAround 20 of the world\u2019s top 25 logistics companies have based their global or regional operations in Singapore. The presence of these big firms drives local companies to emulate international standards,\u201d it stated. \u201cThe Colombo Port starts with several advantages. Amongst them are well situated on international and regional trade routes and a deep enough draught to accommodate Post-Panamex ships. With a limited internal market, Sri Lanka, like Singapore, cannot depend on traffic from its hinterland to develop its port. It must depend on transhipment traffic. Colombo already handles a significant amount of transhipment \u2013 75% of volume; but mostly to India. The expansion of Indian ports poses a threat to this business, but to truly become a hub Colombo needs to look beyond our largest neighbour,\u201d Advocata says. Noting that transhipment is a service that does not add any value to cargo, Advocata says to grow this service lower business costs and productivity are critical. Fast turnaround times and competitive rates are needed, but Sri Lanka\u2019s restrictive ownership rules and fixed fee structures result in higher costs, it points out. \u00a0\u201cUnlike other major ports where cargo handling rates are determined by market conditions, Sri Lanka\u2019s are set by the Central Bank, which decides on agency and transhipment tariffs to local agents. The current fee structure is complicated, encourages malpractice, is determined arbitrarily and adversely affects port and logistics industry competitiveness. To shipping lines working with very thin margins this fixed fee structure represents a significant additional cost. This limits transhipment volumes to the essential \u2013 those that flow naturally due to location. Shipping lines have little incentive to route cargo from further afield. \u00a0\u201cThe Budget proposes to lift restrictions on foreign ownership of shipping agencies and the creation of a port regulator. This is the first step towards attracting the interest of large global shipping lines. Sri Lanka will not become a logistics hub without significant participation of global players. Substantial investments and presence of global firms active on ground is essential toward making the hub ambitions a reality,\u201d Advocata adds. Advocata affirms that with the right reforms in place, Sri Lanka could look to attract Maersk or another leading shipper to establish its South Asia hub in Colombo. \u201cThat would go well beyond its limited activity with its present JV arrangement with a local agent.\u00a0 Sri Lanka can use this anchor investment, to attract other leading shippers to do the same, thereby creating critical mass.\u00a0 This would result in a larger industry, more jobs and more opportunities for the industry as a whole. This would make Sri Lanka fertile ground for the top freight forwarders. It might persuade DHL or others to look at Sri Lanka as a regional hub and large e-commerce companies such as Amazon to use Colombo for warehousing. \u00a0\u201cTherefore, liberalisation is needed. To develop the logistics sector should be open to foreign participation and restrictions (e.g. Sri Lanka Ports Authority monopoly on destuffing local loose cargo), regulations on terminal handling charges etc. should be removed. Foreigners should be permitted to invest in freight forwarding and the minimum investment thresholds and export revenue requirements imposed to be eligible to invest in declared free ports should be eliminated.\u201d \u00a0Warehousing space available within the port is limited and outdated, Advocata further points out, adding that to support the growth of the logistics business, private investment should be permitted within the port; to build and operate new, upgraded warehouses. Alternatively, there should be zoning of a warehousing district outside the port, but in close proximity to it (like Singapore). Other investments include creating logistic networks between producer and consumer areas, markets and transport nodes that connect to the Colombo port, industrial zones and Inland Container Depots (ICD) that speed port access and support a modern logistics corridor. Advocata states that the presence of global third party logistics firms in Sri Lanka will enhance the confidence of multinational manufacturers who will be more willing to use Colombo as a destination for value added logistics functions (e.g. packaging, labelling, quality checking, simple assembly) etc. \u201cThese firms will bring new technology, new knowledge about logistics and supply chain management and are experienced in managing highly sophisticated and complex supply chains for their clients. It is in the trust the global firms have in their logistics companies that make them outsource key logistics and supply chain functions and their presence firms will be a huge value add to the location advantage of Sri Lanka. These firms will also help market Sri Lanka as a destination for logistics, which is needed to get business. This is far easier for such firms with their global presence and networks, than for local businesses. \u00a0\u201cThis would form the core of a maritime-cum-logistics hub as these anchor investments create an ecosystem of supporting services \u2013 financial, legal and other professional services. A maritime-cum-logistics hub would be a boon to competitive local companies with relevant service-support skills, and allow some of the bigger competitive companies to go global.\u201d The Colombo International Financial Centre, a financial hub between Dubai and Singapore, is underway within the Port City. Along with the proposed National Logistics Policy for Shipping and Air Transportation, and the Telecommunication Connectivity Policy it will establish Sri Lanka as the hub of the Indian Ocean. Production and service standards would improve massively from their present woeful state, with more transparency and less corruption, states Advocata. \u00a0\u201cThis aligns with the Port City, linking up the port and airport, a hub around the airport as part of bigger, Vision 2025 plans and would be the beginning of Sri Lanka\u2019s insertion into global value chains beyond garments. The big prizes are in services, not manufacturing, especially with the \u2018servicification\u2019 of global value chain. The lower cargo handling costs and greater efficiency will create spillover benefits to local exporters who in turn will increase their competitiveness, further driving volumes.\u201d \u00a0Opening up the agency business does not necessarily mean the end of the local agents, it emphasises, noting that Singapore has over 5,000 agents and sub agents working for ship owners/operators in numerous support businesses. The shipping and logistics business is continuously evolving and new competition is emerging, says Advocata. An ADB working paper opined that \u201cslow implementation of the Colombo outer harbour development plan has already caused significant damage to Colombo as a transhipment hub. This damage may be repaired, but it is unlikely. Further threats to its current role exist, not least the further development of ports in India.\u201d Advocata adds: \u201cSri Lanka has been lucky for a long time, because we still retain our advantage in terms of serving the Indian Sub-Continent cargo but it is naive to imagine that this will last. Sri Lanka is operating far below its potential, especially in terms of logistics. Therefore, it is important to remove all constraints which prevent us from reaching our potential. \u00a0\u201cThe Budget proposals are a good start but full reform package of port, shipping and warehousing services is needed. This presents much greater opportunities for existing players in the long term and they should seize the challenge. Unless reforms take place, we may well find ourselves stagnating while traffic moves to competitors.\u201d The Advocata Institute is an independent policy think tank based in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

{"topic": "20 cents Medamulana tax charged from banks - Eran", "full_news": "He pointed out that this tax introduced by the Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera in his 2018 budget will be removed after three years.  The Minister made this clarification in response to a query made in this regard by Sri Lanka Mirror.  Minister Wickremeratne said this tax which was imposed in order to repay the debt burden left by the previous regime, \u00a0will in no way have any impact on ordinary citizens.   \u201cThe Sri Lankan government has a huge debt burden to settle within the next three years which amounts to Rs. 7,000 billion. To this Rs. 6,000 billion should be included as maturity each year. \u00a0 Currently we need Rs. 1,970 billion for debt payment just for 2018. Hence we needed to go for an alternative without reducing state investment. That was the reason the new tax was imposed. It will be implemented from April 01, 2018,\u201d said Wickremeratne.         Presenting the budget, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the debt mountain left behind by the Rajapaksa regime is far worse than the garbage mountain the government had inherited by the current regime. Hence this tax had to be introduced. Section 286 of the budget amply explains this situation and accordingly, Rs. 7,000 billion has to be repaid within the next three years while Rs. 6,000 billion is also applicable annually as maturity of Sovereign international bonds.     Rs. 1,970 billion has to be paid as debt repayment for the year 2018 alone.     This excessive debt burden is bound to have a huge impact on state fiscal sector, but state investments cannot be compromised for the coming year either.     Hence, this tax will be charged from financial institutions from April 01, 2018, but it will not be allowed to burden the general public.", "intro": "The twenty cents tax per transactions of Rs. 1000\u00a0 or over will be charged from the financial institution conducting the transaction and not the customer, said State Minister of Media and Finance Eran Wickremeratne.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/5799-20-cents-medamulana-tax-charged-from-banks-eran"},

{"topic": "\u201cDecisions should be taken as in Saudi Arabia\u201d \u2013 Mangala", "full_news": "Social media is rife with numerous views in this regard. According to the Tobacco and Alcohol Authority between 65% - 70% of the country\u2019s population do not consume alcohol. Of this figure around half of them are females, said the Tobacco and Alcohol Authority Chairman Dr. Palitha Abeykone, adding that of the males between 15% - 20% do not consume alcohol. However, he said in comparison with the European countries, even though the percentage is smaller, this category are those who consume alcohol excessively. \u201cIn the western countries the Ethanol usage is around 3.5 to 4 litres per year. However, in some parts of Sri Lanka the individual consumption is over three times that amount.\u201d Alcohol leads to many health and social problems. Some people who cannot afford to purchase legally manufactured alcohol tend to resort to illegally manufactured alcohol. According to official data available, around 10,000 to 15,000 deaths are reported every year due to alcohol consumption.   Meanwhile addressing a media briefing held in Colombo on Friday (10), Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the biggest problem currently affecting Sri Lanka is the consumption of Kasippu (moonshine). Of those consuming alcohol around 49% are those who consume Kasippu and wild toddy (wal ra), according to a survey conducted by the Colombo University recently, the minister said. Irrespective of Kasippu, the minister pointed out that around 84% of Sri Lankans consuming alcohol are in the practice of using hard liquor. However in countries such as Indonesia, Thailand etc people do not consume hard liquor to a great extent. \u201cIn those countries only around 11% - 12% of alcohol consumers use hard liquor while the rest only consume beer. In fact if you look at Europe, this is even more evident,\u201d he said. However, responding to claims that by reducing the price of beer, those consuming it will not stoip at that and would also consume hard liquor he said, \u201cIf we look at it that way and increase the price of beer, those consuming beer will also find that it is then cheaper for them to consume hard liquor,\u201d the minister added. The minister pointed out that there are two mechanisms that a country can adopt in relation to alcohol consumption. \u201cEither we must take a hard stance like in Saudi Arabia or we need to look at it in a practical sense and try to reduce people\u2019s alcohol consumption by way of limiting them to consume soft liquor such as beer. That was the motive in implementing this new formula,\u201d Samaraweera pointed out. However, one cannot claim that consuming beer is better for one\u2019s health than consuming hard alcohol. For example the Ethanol content that one would ingest by consuming alcohol with an alcohol content of 32% is the same as consuming four cans of beer with an alcohol percentage of 8%. When we asked the Tobacco and Alcohol Authority Chairman Dr. Palitha Abeykone if consuming beer was less harmful to the body, he said it was a mere false belief, adding that no matter what you consume it is eventually Ethanol that is consumed. He said two proposals had been made in formulating alcohol policies in Sri Lanka.Among them are: Maintaining the percentage of those not consuming alcohol (65% -70%) at the same level and\u00a0Formulating a plan to gradually reduce the number of persons consuming alcohol. Meanwhile, some had expressed concern over social media that by reducing the price of beer, this could entice the younger generation to consume it.", "intro": "The general public have expressed varying opinions about the decision to reduce the price of beer and taxes to be levied on hard liquor according to its alcohol percentage.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/5768-decisions-should-be-taken-as-in-saudi-arabia-mangala"},

The sale of condominium housing units which were made exempt from taxes from November 1, 2016, have been made liable again after a very short span of 1 year.  However, this will pose several challenges to apartment developers who just went through a significant change from a liable regime to an exempt regime (in November 2016) and would now have to change back to a liable regime from April 1, 2018.

This is expected to reach Sri Lanka by 10 November 2017.the media release said adding that on various occasions in the past, LIOC has offered all its assistance to CPC to procure emergency shipments of petroleum products. It will continue to do so, whenever required.

LIOC has noted that consumers across the country have been facing some shortages of petrol over the last few days. As a reliable distributor of petroleum products in Sri Lanka over many years, LIOC is making all efforts to assist in the early resolution of this problem. However, attempts by some to blame LIOC for causing the shortage are mischievous and factually incorrect, and we categorically reject such allegations, LIOC said. LIOC had procured a shipment (parcel) of 35,000 MT of petrol from the French oil company M/s TOTAL on DAP basis, which arrived in Sri Lanka on 16 October 2017. \u00a0As per routine procedure, the petrol was tested by CPC/CPSTL laboratory before being accepted by LIOC.

LIOC noted that that ownership of the product remains with M/s TOTAL till it satisfies the requirements of LIOC and CPC/CPSTL laboratory. Once a parcel is rejected, LIOC has no further role thereafter and it is the seller's own sole discretion/responsibility to decide when to take out the vessel from Sri Lankan waters. \u00a0 As replacement cargo would have taken at least 25-30 days, M/s TOTAL offered to remove the particles through filtration process, which is a common industry practice, in order to enable expedited delivery by 3-4\u00a0 November 2017 to manage the present crisis.

{"topic": "ITJP questions Coca Cola\u2019s Gajaba Super Cross sponsorship", "full_news": "Writing to Herbert Alan, president of Coca Cola Company, ITJP executive director Yasmin Sooka says it believes this is in violation of the company\u2019s stated human rights policy. The letter says, As you can see from the Sri Lankan media, this sporting event is presided over by Shavendra Silva, who is alleged to be Sri Lanka\u2019s most notorious war criminal. Moreover his Gajaba Regiment, which organised the event,\u00a0 has been implicated in alleged war crimes and violations dating back decades. Shavendra Silva is reported\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 state\u00a0 run\u00a0 newspaper\u00a0 of Sri\u00a0 Lanka to\u00a0 be\u00a0 the\u00a0 head\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 Gajaba\u00a0 Supercross\u00a0 Steering and he is shown prominently in the photographs promoting the event. Moreover the media in Sri Lanka has quoted Major General Silva as saying the funds raised by the championship will be used to help the families of the Gajaba regiment\u2019s \u201cheroes\u201d which contradicts\u00a0 his claims\u00a0 it\u00a0 will\u00a0 assist reconciliation in the former conflict areas. The ITJP claims that in reality this sporting event is an utter affront to Tamil war survivors who still live in poverty and without any accountability for extensive war crimes, including the shelling of civilian objects, torture, summary execution and enforced disappearance committed inter alia by the 58 Division during the final phase of the civil war in 2008-9 when it was under Shavendra Silva\u2019s command. I\u00a0 would like\u00a0 to draw your attention\u00a0 to\u00a0 the United\u00a0 Nations Report\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 OHCHR\u00a0 Investigation\u00a0 on\u00a0 Sri\u00a0 Lanka, which\u00a0 clearly\u00a0 states\u00a0 Shavendra\u00a0 Silva\u00a0 commanded\u00a0 the\u00a0 58\u00a0 Division, Sooka says. The OISL report repeatedly references the 58 Division in connection with alleged Violations,\u00a0 such as killing\u00a0 of\u00a0 surrendees, torture,\u00a0 shelling\u00a0 of\u00a0 UN\u00a0 sites\u00a0 and hospitals\u00a0 [which names Silva]. The OISL report, as mandated by the Human Rights Council,\u00a0 used the standard of \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that an incident occurred when there was sufficiently corroborated information. This\u00a0 constitutes a prima facie case sufficient to indict someone in a court of law and should therefore constitute a reasonable threshold for the Coca Cola company to consider its support for this initiative. It is perhaps pertinent to add that Major General Silva reported directly to General Jagath Jayasuriya during the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka; the ITJP has recently filed a lawsuit against General Jayasuriya in Latin America, where he was based as a diplomat, in connection with his command position in 2008-9. In addition, Shavendra Silva\u2019s alleged role in war crimes has been extensively reported in the media for many years. The former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, reportedly wrote to the UN Secretary General in 2012 raising concerns about Silva being an alleged war criminal. A war crimes lawsuit was filed against Silva in New York in 2011 and failed because he had diplomatic immunity. A South African NGO threatened\u00a0 litigation\u00a0 when\u00a0 it\u00a0 was\u00a0 reported\u00a0 that\u00a0 Silva\u00a0 was\u00a0 to\u00a0 be\u00a0 posted\u00a0 as deputy Ambassador\u00a0 to\u00a0 their country. What\u00a0 is\u00a0 most\u00a0 surprising\u00a0 is\u00a0 that\u00a0 your\u00a0 local\u00a0 Coca\u00a0 Cola\u00a0 representatives\u00a0 in\u00a0 Colombo\u00a0 thought\u00a0 it\u00a0 acceptable\u00a0 to sponsor an event so closely linked to Shavendra Silva and the Gajaba Regiment. We urge you to examine the reports we have referenced\u00a0 and revert to\u00a0 us if you have any queries, says ITJP. We are a small human rights organisation that specialises in documenting testimony of war and torture survivors who\u00a0 have fled Sri Lanka to Europe, some of whom can directly implicate Shavendra Silva in knowledge of alleged crimes by\u00a0 his\u00a0 subordinates\u00a0 such\u00a0 as\u00a0 summary\u00a0 execution,\u00a0 torture,\u00a0 rape\u00a0 and\u00a0 enforced\u00a0 disappearance, it says. The survivors we deal with are extremely traumatised, often suicidal, and are still struggling 8 years after the civil war ended in Sri Lanka, to reunite with family and restart their lives. I hope you can imagine what an insult it is\u00a0 to\u00a0 them\u00a0 to\u00a0 see\u00a0 a\u00a0 global\u00a0 company\u00a0 like\u00a0 yours\u00a0 sponsor\u00a0 the\u00a0 Sri\u00a0 Lankan\u00a0 military\u00a0 regiment\u00a0 and\u00a0 commander allegedly responsible for ruining their lives, Sooka says. She humbly suggests the Coca Cola Company take the following steps: 1. Cancel all sponsorship for military events in Sri Lanka, and in particular those involving Shavendra Silva and the Gajaba Regiment. 2. Investigate\u00a0 how\u00a0 local\u00a0 Coca\u00a0 Cola\u00a0 officials\u00a0 in\u00a0 Colombo\u00a0 endorsed\u00a0 this\u00a0 sponsorship\u00a0 and\u00a0 take disciplinary action. 3.

Jayewardene. While the annual budget of a government was considered a policy framework of the respective government in power in the 1980s, it was converted into a document aimed at popular politics during the past ten years. The government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has once again turned towards giving priority to policies. A forward looking policy statement that focuses on building the future for all sectors the 2018 Budget presents a gamut of proposals that would empower the youth and women in the country.

MEPs also welcomed the establishment of the Office on Missing Persons, but were concerned that more progress had not been achieved on national reconciliation and accountability and encouraged the Government of Sri Lanka to step up efforts to achieve the ambitious goals to which it has committed.

{"topic": "'Sri Lanka Mirror' turns 7!", "full_news": "Since our inception in 2010, 'Sri Lanka Mirror' has been a pioneer of trends in the online media field of Sri Lanka, facing many challenges on the way. We humbly thank our esteemed readership who has been with us on every step of the way giving us courage to go on. 'Sri Lanka Mirror' was launched in an era of darker days for Sri Lankan media when journalists were intimidated, killed or made to disappear for dissent or criticism of the then government. Nevertheless 'Sri Lanka Mirror' did not hesitate to report fearlessly, occasionally rising against the then political regime. It also resulted in our website being censored and blocked several times over the years, and the staff even being arrested and remanded at one point. Although such days have faded past and we enter our eighth year of operations, we are still facing fresh challenges. Despite being in the reign of good governance, corruption and waste remains rampant. Also, there seems much to be done to build the bridge of reconciliation, to unite the North and the South. However, our hopes for a peaceful, united and prosperous country with minimum corruption and waste remains the same and therein lies our challenge. During times where the reach of online media is surpassing more traditional forms of media, we hope to do our best to achieve this dream. The CID was not the first hurdle faced by 'Sri Lanka Mirror'. Barely after one year of operations, on Nov. 05, 2011, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) imposed an access control on the website with no prior warning. The access control was imposed in a background where 'Sri Lanka Mirror' had already applied to be registered with the Ministry of Mass Communication on July 11, 2011 as a reputed media institution. At that stage, 'Sri Lanka Mirror' was ranked 04th among the major news websites in Sri Lanka with a daily readership of 25,000 - 30,000 and a lucrative advertising revenue of around Rs. 500,000. On the same day of imposing the sudden access control, the Information Department announced it was mandatory for all websites to be registered. After reapplying for registration on Nov. 09, 2011, we obtained a license from the Ministry of Mass Media and Information and since then, we have been functioning as a registered news website in the country. In addition, we legally challenged the sudden access control and on Dec 15 2011, the Supreme Court ordered to lift the access control imposed on the website. Faced with severe financial hardships, the web team persisted and had even forgone their salaries. Yet another attack was forthcoming. On 2012, June 29, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) raided the SLM office then located on No. 71, Ferry Road, Ethul Kotte, Colombo, arresting five journalists (namely Srilankamirror editor Kelum Shivantha, photographer Ajith Seneviratne, journalists Shiranthani Manawadu, Himashi Karunaratne and Tharindu Rajapakse) and office assistant R.W. Premawathie. In addition, Subhash Jayawardena and Siddique Kariyappar - two journalists of srilankaxnews.com - which was functioning from a different storey of the same building were arrested as well. Computers used by the staff were seized as well. Ms. Premawathie was released later in the night while the others were released on police bail on June 30. They were charged of violating Articles 115, 188 and 120 of the Penal Code. However, by then, the Article 118 was already nullified by the Amendment Act No. 12 of 2002. On September 18, 2013, Colombo additional magistrate Prasanna Alwis ordered the release of Sri Lanka Mirror and Srilankaxnews journalists, until such time notice is issued on them to appear before the court again. Although the magistrate ordered to release the seized computers after retaining the hard disks, the computers are yet to be released. However, the arrested staff of Sri Lanka Mirror and Srilankaxnews filed Fundamental Rights petitions citing that their right to freedom of expression and to engage in a profession of their choice in accordance with clauses 13-1, 14-1(A) and 14-1(G) of the constitution have been violated. The FR petitions are still being heard in the Supreme Court. It is our style to report the truth in an unbiased manner. Although this style would not always be agreeable to governments or rulers, we have thrived to push on holding our head high, even through dark days of media suppression. Nevertheless, we drew our strength from our readers and many well wishers who were truly with us through thick and thin. This combination enabled us to set many trends in the field and become the best news website in Sri Lanka. In 2012, the Mirror family won five awards at the Best web competition 2012 organised by the LK domain registry. 'Sri Lanka Mirror' received the overall bronze award for the best Sri Lankan website as well as the gold for the best news website in Sri Lanka. We also received bronze under special awards - Sinhala sites. In addition, our hosting and web developing company \u2013 Winhost Inc. was awarded silver under the best web developer category for their work on mirror.lk. Further, our then sister site mirrorarts.lk won the silver award in the entertainment/lifestyle category. Even though we were lauded by our leadership for our independent reporting style, it is a well known fact back then that the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) and the state owned Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) extended 'frosty' relations. The site was blocked since May 12, 2014 and on inquiring from the Internet Service Providers they have informed us the website has been blocked after the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) informed them to do so. Though attempts were made to contact the then Director General of the TRC - Anusha Palpita in this regard, we were informed by his secretary that Mr. Palpita was currently overseas and would be returning on May 17, 2014. Soon afterwards, we directed a formal correspondence to him with copies forwarded to then President, Opposition Leader, Minister of Media and Defence Secretary. On May 21, 2014 a complaint was also filed with the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) over the block. Simultaneously, the Professional Web Journalists' Association (PWJA) also filed a complaint with the HRCSL, against access control imposed on eight websites including Sri Lanka Mirror, Lanka E News, Lanka News Web, Lanka Guardian, Tamil Net, Colombo Telegraph, The Independent, and Jaffna Tamils. Even though the HRCSL pledged to provide a solution within a fortnight, such measures are yet to be taken. Although ISPs Dialog, Etisalat, Mobitel and Airtel removed the access control imposed on Sri Lanka Mirror, the block remained on the island's main ISP provider - Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) for a prolonged period of time. Though 'Sri Lanka Mirror' was summoned on Sep. 16, 2014 over the complaint lodged, the HRCSL had informed that an alternate date would be given as the then Director General of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) - Anusha Palpita would not able to appear on the said date. The date remains pending. In 2014, a parliamentary debate was also held regarding the imposed access control over several news websites including 'Sri Lanka Mirror'. The debate was held following a suggestion made by the General Secretary of United National Party (UNP), Tissa Attanayake, when the parliament was adjourned on July 29, 2014. Parliamentarians Tissa Attanayake, Ajith P. Perera and Mangala Samaraweera took up the issue of 'Sri Lanka Mirror' during the debate. Details pertaining to the debate can be found on pages 607 - 627 of the June 29 Hansard. On October 2014, UN Human Rights Committee member Ms. Anja Seibert - Fohr raised the issue of website censorship while reviewing Sri Lanka at the 112 session of the committee. Noting that they have received reports of news websites such as 'Sri Lanka Mirror', 'Lanka E News' and 'The Colombo Telegraph' being blocked within Sri Lanka, Ms. Seibert - Fohr has urged the Sri Lankan delegation to clarify on which legal provisions these websites were censored.", "intro": "We, 'Sri Lanka Mirror' today (01) celebrate seven years since the launch of our website - www.srilankamirror.com.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/5616-sri-lanka-mirror-turns-7"},

Sri Lanka regained access to the European Union\u2019s GSP plus trade concession in May after losing it earlier over the island\u2019s failure to meet commitments related to human rights and labour rights. The EU noted that if Sri Lanka continues to make the necessary progress, then the country has the chance to benefit from the scheme until it achieves Upper Middle Income country status for three consecutive years. On current trends, that should mean that Sri Lanka will benefit from GSP+ until at least 2021.

In 2016, total bilateral trade amounted to almost \u20ac4 billion, and EU imports from Sri Lanka amounted to \u20ac2.6 billion. The removal of import duties provide a total of immediate benefits worth in excess of EUR 300 million a year.

Bathiudeen. The attack launched subsequent to an instigating meeting of the BBS this attack was carried out against the Aluthgama Muslim people three years ago, resulting in the death of three persons and injuring over fifty and also causing millions of rupees in damage to property. Despite the Sri Lanka Muslim Council and several other organisations notifying the former DIG of the possibility of inciting communal clashes by the nationalist meeting held by the BBS, he had ignored their warnings and concerns, the community leaders complained to the Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence Pablo de Greiff. They had told the UN Envoy that Senanayake had said, \u201cThe meeting is being held with the consent of higher authorities and I cannot stop it. Over 3,000 STF personnel will be deployed for security.\u201d The community leaders had told him that a huge destruction was caused as no action was taken to stop the clash. Mohomed Firaz, Mohomed Sahuran and Mohomed Imra died as a result of this clash.

It is a timely requirement in the spirit of democracy that all parties cooperate to ensure the implementation of the proposed solutions, to cease disruptions thus far caused to the smooth functioning of universities and especially to provide an opportunity to students to return for education. In keeping with the principle of justice to all stakeholders, the Government hopes to implement the following courses of action: 1. Abolishing SAITM (hereinafter SAITM means its Faculty of Medicine): This shall be done in a manner legally acceptable to the current shareholders, lending institutions and the new entity interested in taking over all operations and management of SAITM on a not-for-profit basis, thus ending the ownership and management structure of SAITM. The profit oriented entity owned and managed by Dr. Neville Fernando and family would thereby cease to exist.   2. By an agreement reached by the above parties, the assets, liabilities, staff and students of SAITM shall be transferred to a non-state, not-for-profit making (that will utilize any excess income over expenditure of the organization for development or research or scholarships, without distributing among shareholders) degree awarding entity that will comply with the Minimum Standards on Medical Education and Training (to be legislated).   3. The Government has consulted several already established non-state, not-for-profit entities with the objective of establishing the proposed not-for-profit entity for this purpose.

Arrangements shall be made for the said students who have completed the degree at SAITM to undergo clinical training at recommended government hospitals.   6. Admission of medical students to SAITM has been suspended by the letter issued by the Secretary of the Ministry of Higher Education on September 15th 2017. This suspension will continue. Accordingly, all new admissions shall be made to the new entity (as described in 2 above), when only complying with the Minimum Standards on Medical Education and Training (to be legislated). The Government shall cooperate on all endeavors to make available, through financial institutions, subsidized student loan schemes to eligible students from low-income families to meet the cost of tuition and fees.    7. Current shareholders of SAITM shall not participate in the ownership or management of the new entity. The cooperation of Dr. Neville Fernando and family is extremely important in this regard.   8. The Ministry of Health shall gazette and place before Parliament the agreed Minimum Standards for Medical Education and Training based on the Draft submitted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), upon conclusion of discussions with the SLMC, the Hon. Attorney General and other relevant stakeholders. This task must be mandatorily completed within one month from today.

The team had previously worked on the Australian Defence White Paper of 2016 and brought it to fruition in the Australian parliament. Their aim was to impart the Australian knowledge and experience to the Sri Lanka defence establishment. The Secretary of Defence highlighted the role of INSSSL as the premier national security think tank in managing to organize an important and relevant workshop which will benefit the Ministry of Defence in such a short span of time. \u2018An effective defence policy would enable Sri Lanka as a country to use the resources and capabilities it has to a more effective degree when protecting our national interests, and to maintain our preventative capabilities against threats that are both external and internal. This would remain a key defence priority for the country based on the experiences we have faced in the last few decades\u2019. In this regard, the Secretary emphasized the emboldening of the Australian-Sri Lankan defence relationship through this workshop. Acting Australian High Commissioner, Mr. Tim Huggins, also re-iterated the \u2018extraordinary 70th year in the bilateral relationship\u2019 between Australia and Sri Lanka and in the most recent visit by H.E.

The Director General of INSSSL, Mr. Abeyagoonasekera stated that as a nation, Sri Lanka stands to gain a lot from this workshop as it will give us \u2018clarity of the journey we wish to navigate\u2019. The workshop will aim at understanding the commonalties that both Sri Lanka and Australia face in the larger Pacific Ocean in the Indian Ocean. \u2018Australia is seen as a neutral power in the Pacific and Sri Lanka could be a stabilizer in the Indian Ocean protecting and creating a peaceful surrounding at a time of the rise of China and emerging India happening in Asia\u2019. Thus, \u2018the defence white paper could assist to resolve the complexity of the nation\u2019s defence strategy\u2019 and thereby help to abate public apathy. \u2018INSSSL through its leadership by His Excellency the President and Secretary of Defence has embarked today on this important mission, to facilitate and assist the defence establishment to transfer the knowledge of the Australian White Paper\u2019.

He said a war crimes complaint last month in Brazil against Sri Lanka's then ambassador, a former war general, underscored the risk faced by local military personnel even in their retirement. \"As the recent case presented in Brazil against a former member of the armed forces demonstrates, accountability will be sought either here (in Sri Lanka) or abroad,\" de Greiff said at the end of a two-week. He said the attempted prosecution of retired general Jagath Jayasuriya was the \"tip of the iceberg.\" He feared more such cases in foreign jurisdictions unless Colombo ensured a credible domestic investigation. Two days after the South African-based rights group, the International Truth and Justice Project, filed cases against Jayasuriya, he left Brazil in what Colombo said was at the end of his two-year posting. De Greiff criticised Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena's public claim that he will not allow \"war heroes\" to be prosecuted for alleged war crimes. Sri Lanka faced international censure over the failure of the former regime to acknowledge civilian casualties while battling Tamil Tiger guerrillas. Sirisena's government came to power in January 2015 on a promise to ensure justice for war victims. However, after two years in power, Sirisena's administration had been slow to deliver on accountability. Unlike his predecessor Mahinda Rajapakse, Sirisena has agreed to investigate war crimes, but is yet to set up a mechanism for it. De Greiff said there had been no progress even in some of the \"emblematic cases\" of rights abuses and said the government's plan to grant reparations and ensure non-recurrence was not a substitute to accountability. He urged the government to \"adopt a comprehensive transitional justice strategy that includes a clear calendar\" and also asked Colombo to draw on the expertise of the UN human rights chief's office.

Mahindra & Mahindra ranked highest in the sales satisfaction index, followed by Toyota and Ford. The 2017 India Sales Satisfaction Index (Mass Market) Study is based on responses from 7,831 new-vehicle owners, who purchased vehicles between September 2016 and April 2017.

In order of impact on overall sales satisfaction, those factors are sales initiation (17 per cent); dealer facility (17 per cent); deal and paperwork (17 per cent); delivery timing (17 per cent); salesperson (16 per cent); and delivery process (16 per cent). According to the press statement issued by JD Power, the overall sales satisfaction index for the industry improves significantly: Overall satisfaction increases by 31 points (on a 1,000-point scale) from 2016. Key factors contributing to this improvement include a higher implementation rate on process standards; an increase in the number of amenities made available at dealer facilities; and a drop in pressures and problems experienced by customers during the shopping experience.    \u201cOur Vision at Ideal Motors is to strive to be the most trusted, innovative, and respected brand in the industry, focusing on total commitment to our customers and employees right from the start and it gives us enormous satisfaction and pride to represent a brand such as Mahindra\u201d, said Chairman Ideal Group, Nalin Welgama.

The minister highlighting the recent economic developments and prospects in Sri Lanka said that although still growing below potential, Sri Lanka\u2019s economy is expected to grow by around 4.5 per cent in 2017 and projected to move to a higher growth path of around 7.0 per cent by 2020 with the ongoing broader structural reforms and enhanced investor confidence. The reform initiatives towards this direction are supported by the 3-year arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of US$ 1.5 billion that Sri Lanka entered in to with the IMF in June 2016. The program aims to strengthen the external and fiscal balances of the economy. Although headline inflation remained above the envisaged mid-single digit levels, core inflation decelerated gradually, reflecting the containment of demand driven inflationary pressures in the economy resulting from restrictive monetary policy measures adopted since end 2015. On the fiscal front, the Minister said that there was a significant improvement, reflecting the government\u2019s strong commitment towards revenue based fiscal consolidation. Sri Lanka\u2019s external sector recorded a mixed performance during the first half of 2017. The country\u2019s gross official reserves improved to US$ 7.3 billion by end-September 2017 which was equivalent to about 4.5 months of imports. The Sri Lankan rupee has depreciated by 2.2 per cent against the US dollar so far during the year.\u00a0 The exchange rate regime is now flexible and market-oriented. The financial sector continued its growth momentum during the first half of 2017 with improved stability and soundness with improved capital adequacy, liquidity and asset quality of the banking sector. Mr Mangala Samaraweera reiterating the broad development strategy the unity government of President and the Prime Minister focuses said that it was on a three-pillared agenda of democratization, reconciliation, and sustainable and equitable development with employment generation that transmits the benefits of growth across the wider society. \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s growth model would be private sector driven with exports and FDI as key pillars, supported by technological advancement and innovation,\u201d said Minister of Finance Mangala Samaraweera. In this process, we are committed to improve human capital and skills, set up globally recognized regulatory mechanisms and investment practices, in addition to the improvement of physical infrastructure, and create the best possible enabling environment for Sri Lanka to attract more businesses, trade and investment to become a higher income country. The Minister addressing this august assembly further stated \u201cWe have introduced three well thought-out frameworks to manage the country\u2019s fiscal policy, monetary policy and foreign exchange operations to ensure sound macroeconomic policies. State Owned Enterprises are also being reformed to ensure efficient management and strengthen financial viability. We are working, with commitment, to move to a flexible inflation targeting regime in the medium term to ensure sustained low inflation and to an exchange rate regime based on clear parameters to achieve a competitive currency. \u201cMr. Chairman, expanding exports is a key priority. In addition to the restoration of preferential access to the EU markets, measures are being taken to boost market access through deepening and widening the current FTA with India; invigorating the FTA with Pakistan; signing new economic partnership agreements with China and Singapore. This will result in preferential access to markets with over 3 billion people, which is expected to boost domestic and foreign investments going forward through leveraging the trade/investment nexus.\u00a0 Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) related reforms are also being introduced to improve the doing business environment.\u201d \u201cThe broader objective of this process is to position Sri Lanka as an export-oriented economic and financial hub at the center of the Indian Ocean, effectively leveraging its strategic location.Mr. Chairman, Sri Lanka has achieved significant progress in its social development indicators due to the government\u2019s continued efforts and the support of the development partners. I take this opportunity to thank the World Bank Group for their continued support to Sri Lanka in terms of financial assistance for development projects and technical assistance for analytical and advisory services. I believe that its Country Partnership Framework for 2017 - 2020 would help reinforce the Bank\u2019s financing arrangements, thereby enhancing its role in the country\u2019s development. The government is keenly working on addressing significant regional growth and income disparities in the country through a well-focused development program. Financial inclusion is being strengthened and labor force participation of women is being improved. In order to achieve the desired objectives however, it is essential that more concessionary financial assistance through innovative financial tools and products from international financial institutions is available to develop infrastructure facilities of the lagging regions and also to provide basic needs, such as health, education and sanitary facilities. We strongly believe these are essential ingredients for development with reconciliation. Sri Lanka has now been graduated from \u201cIDA eligible\u201d status to \u201cIBRD eligible\u201d status and has access to both the IDA and IBRD credits under the IDA Transitional Support Facility during the IDA 18 cycle.

It is the first time that one of the kingpins of the Rajapaksa administration admitted, in the former war zone, that armed forces had committed crimes. His remarks strengthened charges made by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka that there may have been individuals who stepped out of line and who should be investigated and punished to clear the good name of the Sri Lankan forces. Asked for his views on Field Marshal Fonseka\u2019s remarks, including his willingness to testify before any war crimes tribunal, Rajapaksa said he was reluctant to comment, but ended up admitting to \u201ccrimes\u201d by security forces. \u201cI think our forces didn\u2019t do war crimes, but individuals might have done. It is not war crimes. We can call (it) crimes,\u201d Rajapasksa said dispensing with a Sinhala-Tamil translator and switching to English.

However, they quickly fell out over who should take the credit for the spectacular military success. In Jaffna yesterday, Basil Rajapaksa also dropped another bombshell declaring that his new party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP), a breakaway faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), supports the full return of all occupied private land in Jaffna. He said occupied land should not only be returned to Tamil owners, but those who did not originally own property should be given state land, a position that is in sharp contrast to nationalist elements supporting his brother. The SLPP had insisted on the military maintaining its hold on private land occupied during the war.Basil said the issue of people who had disappeared during and after the war should be addressed \u201chumanely\u201d and a solution found at the earliest. \u201cIt is a question that must be addressed. We were trying to solve it (during our time), it is an emotional issue. It must be solved in a very humane way,\u201d he said without going into details. Rajapaksa lamented that moderate Tamil parties did not cooperate with the Rajapaksa regime, but was accommodating the government of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. The SLPP was venturing into Jaffna for the first time to set up a village level organisation to kick off their party activities in the former conflict zones, he added.

{"topic": "Is Sri Lanka\u2019s Tamil party selling out the", "full_news": "On Sept 21, 2017, the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly presented its report on the new constitution to Parliament proposing the devolution of power within a unitary state. This proposal is far short of what the Tamils have asked for. The question is: will the proposals be a step towards resolving the national question, or simply be an enabler to repeat the grievances which led the country to 30 years of civil war? At the election in 2015, the three biggest parties in parliament today: the United National Party (UNP), the United People\u2019s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) promised a new constitution. But the vision for that constitution was not uniform. The UNP and UPFA manifestos unequivocally rejected a federal constitution. The TNA, on the other hand, asked voters to support its demand for a constitution based on shared sovereignty: \u201cPower sharing arrangements must continue to be established as it existed earlier in a unit of a merged Northern and Eastern Provinces based on a Federal structure.\u201d These power-sharing arrangement refer to an elected central government in Colombo \u2013 which has traditionally had overwhelming Sinhala-Buddhist majorities \u2013 sharing power with the nine elected provincial councils. Of the nine, only the North has a Tamil majority, while the Tamil-speaking Muslims and Tamil constitute a majority in the Eastern Province. The focus of the TNA\u2019s proposals is the Northern and Eastern provinces. The Steering Committee\u2019s report of 2017 does not propose a federal state and has created questions among the Tamil population. TNA Leader R. Sampanthan to assuage these questions, while accepting the steering committee\u2019s report in 2017 said: \u201cWe must not be hanging on to words like federalism. In many countries across the world, power is shared without any name [given to the arrangement].\u201d But the issue goes much further than mere nomenclature. The Tamils demanded federalism to ensure access to political power. But the proposals, although in some ways reining in the central government\u2019s reach by restricting the provincial governor\u2019s authority, will continue to retain enormous power that will deter the Tamils and Muslims from controlling even internal matters of the northern and eastern provinces. A brief look at three issues \u2013 policy-making, land and public security \u2013 will illustrate how the Centre will retain power. Under the current constitution, the provision that the national government shall set \u201cNational Policy on all Subjects and Functions\u201d irks provincial policy-makers, especially from the North and East. They see this provision enabling the central government to interfere in the internal affairs of the provinces. In the proposed constitution, the Steering Committee recommends that the cabinet of ministers of the central government make national policy. While the proposals go on to state that \u201cnational policy shall not override statutes enacted by the provinces on devolved subjects coming within their competence,\u201d and should not \u201ctake back powers already devolved to the provinces,\u201d there is a caveat. National policy could override provincial policy if enacted as part of national legislation \u201caccording with constitutional provisions.\u201d The proposals do not specify what these constitutional provisions are. However, from what can be gleaned from the proposals, it appears to be a two-third majority of parliament, of an upper chamber and probably a referendum. The Steering Committee has proposed an upper chamber, but there is nothing either in its powers or composition that appear to guarantee that it can prevent discriminatory legislation against the provinces. Therefore the Steering Committee\u2019s proposals use a tortuous path to achieve the same ends as the present constitution: using the central government majorities to stifle even minimal power-sharing with the provinces. The Steering Committee\u2019s proposals on provincial land also appear benign in the beginning, but do little to loosen the Centre\u2019s grip on the provinces. The proposal has to be seen in the context of the protests in the North and East demanding that private land now occupied by the military be given back to the owners. There is also widespread disenchantment that the government sponsors settlement of Sinhalese in Tamil and Muslim-majority areas to skew existing demographics and change parliamentary representation. The Steering Committee\u2019s proposals on provincial land give priority to settle the landless of the province in land settlement schemes. That is well and good. But it is after the new constitution comes into effect. Those in \u201clawful possession or occupation\u201d of land on provincial soil immediately before the new constitution comes into effect will continue possession of their land. What is more, land allotment not completed in provincial land development schemes \u201cshall be according to the criteria that applied to such schemes prior to the commencement of the Constitution.\u201d These provisions will ensure that the new constitution does not halt the government\u2019s pernicious efforts to effect demographic change and thereby the configuration of political power. Committee\u2019s proposals also permit the government to acquire land \u201creasonably\u201d required by the Centre. Similarly, land needed for national security can be \u201ctaken over\u201d by the government. Incidentally, there is no mention of compensation. The third issue is public security. The Steering Committee states that \u201cif the provincial administration \u201cis promoting armed rebellion or engaging in intentional violation of the constitution\u201d the president can assume the powers of the provincial governor, chief minister and board of ministers. However, these measures will be subject to parliamentary approval and judicial review. This degree of central control of an elected sub-unit can be seen as acceptable where power is devolved under a unitary constitution. But if it is a federal constitution, a president will have to at least consult the elected chief minister before exercising those powers. There has been considerable applause in the Steering Committee\u2019s inclusion of the words Sri Lanka \u201cwould be undivided and indivisible\u201d as a measure to prevent a public security issue as when North-East Province Chief Minister A. Varatharajaperumal announced unilateral declaration of independence in 1990. But there is a downside to bypass consulting or working with an elected chief minister on public security. Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran has repeatedly censured the military\u2019s presence and interference with civic life in the province. But since he is constitutionally barred from working on such matters, civilians in the North and East bear the brunt of a militarised society. The Steering Committee\u2019s proposals will only perpetuate this problem. The above three examples attest to an obvious gap between what the TNA promised the Tamil people in 2015 and the Steering Committee proposals it has accepted in 2017. An argument for the party\u2019s stance is that political realism dictates it. The Federal Party, which was negotiating the 1972 constitution on behalf of the Tamils when it withdrew from the Constituent Assembly, was to unleash a series of events that ended in 30 years of bloodshed. But on the other hand, if the spirit of the proposed new constitution is unable to prevent the calamities that are befalling the Tamils and Muslims under the present one, what is the worth of such a document? At the same meeting where he advised Tamils not to hang on to words like federalism, Sampanthan said, \u201cWe (TNA) won\u2019t sell out the Tamil people. We will not pawn our people\u2019s rights\u2026\u201d If the TNA is sincere about not selling out Tamil interests it needs to renegotiate the constitutional proposals with the other parties. Otherwise, it will be a betrayal of the Tamil people\u2019s trust.

The website says the President of Sri Lanka has initiated a comprehensive set of reconciliatory initiatives to heal the wounds of the civil war, which culminated in a military onslaught by the State Military on the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) in 2009. His insistence on inclusive reconciliation therefore stands out as an example to be followed, especially in a situation where support for the International Criminal Court (ICC) and other transitional justice mechanisms is deteriorating. In early 2017, the Sri Lankan Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms released its final report. This goes hand in hand with a range of other efforts, including a consultative process on constitutional reform. A Nobel Peace Prize to President Sirisena would fit a tradition of honouring pragmatic leaders who show political courage, and it would draw attention to reconciliation as a key to sustainable peace, PRIO noted in the website.

BBS and its leader Ven. Gnanasara Thera are ready to visit Myanamr soon to meet his Counterpart Ven. Virathu and discuss negotiations to bring a lasting solution to this issue and look into Humanitarian Assistance to all vulnerable groups belonging to all sectors. We are closely working with all parties such as Ven. Virathu on bringing a constructive Solution. A deadlock erupted in Colombo when the members of several Nationalist movements including Buddhist monks located and stormed into a place where Rohingya refugees were clandestinely kept. Members of the Nationalist movements and the Buddhist monks faced tirades of criticisms due to their boisterous behaviour following the incident. However, this incident has led to creating a negative image of the Nationalist movements and Buddhist monks in the country. Many media organizations and various local and international movements began to label Buddhist monks as \u2018violent and aggressive\u2019 and reprehended their behaviour for not being kind to the transitional refugees of Myanmar. The intention of this communiqu\u00e9 is to inform you of the non-involvement of Bodu Bala Sena in the incident. The incident sent waves of tension across the country as well as abroad and the international media began to label all Nationalist and Buddhist movements as \u2018militant\u2019. However, Bodu Bala Sena would like to inform you that we neither encourage nor approve acts of that nature. Bodu Bala Sena is on the firm view that the Buddhists of Sri Lanka should stand up for the rights of Buddhists in Myanmar and the Rohingya refugees should be dealt with in a delicate and lawful manner. We are aware that Sri Lanka has signed a pact with regard to acceptance of refugees into the country, hence, should not contravene the rights of refuges who transitionally arrive in the country. There is a well-established judiciary system in the country that we can place our full credibility on. So, we should let the law of the country deal with the Rohingya refugees according to the existing law. Bodu Bala Sena believes that the Buddha Sasana of the country should be preserved and protected from all possible threats. We will not remain inactive if the Buddha Sasana of the country is threatened. We will fight against extremism of any nature to preserve the sovereignty of the country. Bodu Bala Sena would like to mention that some extremist Muslim politicians in the government and their stooges protested opposite the Myanmar Embassy in Sri Lanka in a disturbing, aggressive and unwarranted manner disrupting the affairs of the Embassy. This type of racial and hateful activities of Muslim politicians in the government as well as the government\u2019s contradictory statements on the Rohingya refugees had led to creating tension with regard to the Rohingya issue. However, Bodu Bala Sena has informed the public via press releases and press conferences to be peaceful and act wisely with regard to the issue. We expect that the government will take necessary action to send these refugees to where they came from in a more humanistic and lawful manner. Hence, Bodu Bala Sena would like to request the people not to be deceived or misled by the propaganda against Bodu Bala Sena that it is involved in harassing the Rohingya refugees. Bodu Bala Sena proclaim the non- involvement of the organization in this issue. However, BBS is ready to fight all forms of extremism and terrorism while protecting Human Rights and the Rule of Law.

Former finance minister Ravi Karunanayake had jacked up taxes on vehicles across the board in his 2016 budget as the country faced a serious balance of payments crisis on a mistaken notion that imports, rather than money printing by the Central Bank caused the crisis. Following a successful IMF bailout and monetary policy measures to stem the flow of foreign exchange out of the country, policy makers have been considering a more pragmatic tax structure for vehicles. Officials noted that the volume of government revenue increased when the new administration shortly after coming to power in January 2015 sharply lowered customs duties on cars as well as other vehicles at a time when imports had just started to pick up. The government also gave a hefty salary hike to state workers, and many families with a state worker employees made a beeline to the leasing company. The number of car registrations which reached a high of 105,628 in 2015 dropped sharply the following year to 45,172. This year, only about 23,000 cars were registered in the first eight months underscoring the revenue loss. Electric cars are likely to be offered more incentives as the government has already begun an ambitious program which offers subsidised credit to set up solar panels to harness electricity from the sun. Electric cars, which came in virtually tax free at one time, were taxed again by the current administration because they found to be a typical 'Greenscam' tax-avoidance scheme for richer families who were able to buy a second car paying little or no taxes, while even motorcycle owners were paying tax. Electricity produced in Sri Lanka is about 40 percent by coal. \"Any concessions for electric cars will be aimed at utilitarian vehicles and not the expensive electric sports models,\" an official said. Several new car importers had already begun offering hefty discounts on small 800 cc engine capacity cars fearing that they may be left wth inventory left imported at higher tax rates. The introduction of a new Nissan Leaf electric car has seen a sharp drop in the second hand value of these vehicles in the local market and dealers noted a sharp decline in the demand. Only 10 Nissan Leaf cars were registered in August this year, compared to 44 a year ago. From a high of 459 Leaf cars in January 2015, it has now dropped to about 10 a month despite the tax advantage for this category. Last month, minister Samaraweera slashed tax on single cab vehicles by 300,000 rupees and also lifted the 100 percent ad volarem tax on small motorcycles, mainly those imported directly from Japan.\u00a0", "intro": "", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/5035-smaller-electric-cars-to-be-cheaper-after-budget"},

The fatal illness was diagnosed three months into her pregnancy. She has told BBC Sinhala Service on condition of anonymity that only a mother would know the sufferings due to such children. The woman said doctors told her that the existing laws on abortion did not allow her to end her pregnancy. When she delivered under caesarean section, she too, became gravely ill, and she said that had something happened to her, the first-born, a four-and-a-half year old, would not have anyone left in the world. Parents of children with birth defects face social as well as economic hardships. Also, underage girls raped by a family member have to endure untold physical and mental sufferings. In India, a 10-year-old was not allowed an abortion by courts after she was raped, and she delivered in August. Similar instances are reported from Sri Lanka too. According to clause 303 of the penal code, abortion is allowed only if there is a life-threatening situation for the mother from the foetus. The Perinatal Society of Sri Lanka has proposed to the government to allow abortion to terminate pregnancy of a woman carrying a child with a fatal birth defect or in the case of a rape victim. It could be established within the first 15 to 20 weeks of pregnancy if the child has a fatal illness. Doctors say most are stillbirths in such cases, and the others die within the first seven days of birth. Dr. Kapila Jayaratne of the Family Health Bureau says it is a burden both socially and economically to care for a woman carrying a child with a birth defect, and for the child itself if it lives for a brief period. He notes that despite whatever religious beliefs are there, the women who undergo such situations should be considered humanely and allowed to take their own decision. Dr. Jayaratne adds that safeguards could be taken to prevent the misuse of a relaxation of abortion laws. Bureau reports say nearly 6,000 children with birth defects are born every year. Of them, 200-250 die within the first seven days and 500-600 within the first year. Birth defects are also blamed for 1,710 stillbirths per annum. However, the Catholic Bishops Conference says it vehemently condemns legalizing abortion under any circumstances. From the day of conceiving, the life begins, and the life is sacred, and no one has the right to destroy it, it said in a recent statement. At the Vatican, Pope Francis last year gave the right to priests to pardon a woman who had undergone abortion.", "intro": "", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/4997-only-a-mother-knows-the-suffering"},

This is the framework within which the Constitution will be evolved and which all of us will voluntarily acknowledge and accept.

Sampanthan also added that ever since then, successive Presidents and Governments have come up with greatly improved proposals that could bring a final resolution of the national question. \u201cDuring President R. Premadasa\u2019s term there were the Mangala Moonesinghe Select Committee Proposals, during President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga\u2019s term there were the August 2000 Constitutional proposals brought to Parliament with Cabinet approval,\u201d the Opposition Leader said. \u201cDuring President Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s term there were the proposals formulated by the Multi Ethnic Committee of Experts appointed by him, and the Report of the All Parties Representative Committee headed by Prof. Tissa Vitharana, submitted to President Mahinda Rajapaksa.\u201d Sampanthan added that there was substantial consensus,around all those proposals, though for various extraneous reasons, they could not be incorporated into the Constitution. He added that this process could be termed as a continuation of earlier processes, taking place in an altogether different environment, with every possibility of success, if all are reasonable and committed not to miss this opportunity. \u201cReasonable and acceptable Constitutional arrangements recognising their identity and dignity have been a long standing goal of the Tamil speaking People,\u201d said Opposition Leader. \u201cThere are many such arrangements the World over. Consequences of non-resolution have had diverse ramifications on the Tamil people and the whole country; educated qualified Citizens of this country particularly Tamils and Sinhalese have left this Country and taken residence abroad depriving this Country of a great deal of talent; the reputation of this Country has been greatly tarnished internationally having an adverse impact on the Country and its future in several ways; We need to salvage our reputation and win international respect.\u201d The Opposition Leader also said that the country\u2019s economy has been greatly handicapped and has been left behind in the economic field, while other Countries in the region have progressed steadily enabling the Citizens of those Countries whose standard of living was lower than us to enjoy a much higher standard of living than we have in our Country, expenditure of vast sums on Defence has deprived us of substantial resources for development in several vital areas, contributing to backwardness. \u201cAll these factors make it imperative that we create for our country, a new future, based upon a new supreme and basic law and that we jointly endeavour to succeed in the fulfillment of this sacred task,\u201d Opposition Leader Sampanthan said.

{"topic": "Sri Lankan baby trade: Minister admits illegal adoption trade", "full_news": "Up to 11,000 children may have been sold to European families, with both parties being given fake documents. Some were reportedly born into \"baby farms\" that sold children to the West. Sri Lanka's health minister told the Dutch current affairs programme Zembla he would set up a DNA database to help children find their birth mothers. About 4,000 children are thought to be have ended up with families in the Netherlands, with others going to other European countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Germany and the UK. One adoptee called Rowan van Veelen, told the BBC earlier this year that he had travelled back to Sri Lanka to try to find his birth mother 27 years on. He was part of a Netherlands-based social media network that tried to match Sri Lankan birth mothers to their estranged adopted children. \"The adopted children and the mothers got the wrong information, which makes it really hard,\" he explained. \"We want to make a DNA bank with all adopted children from [the] Netherlands who can search if we have siblings there. \"Then we could ask other countries like Sweden, Denmark and Germany to give their DNA also in the bank too.\" The Dutch filmmakers from Zembla started looking into the allegations after the Dutch Council for the Administration of Criminal Justice and Protection of Juveniles advised the government in November 2016 to consider banning foreign adoptions because of unethical practices in some of the children's origin countries. Norbert Reinjens, a researcher for Zembla, told the BBC that they had found evidence that all kind of documents were falsified by adoption authorities - including birth certificates, the names of children and the identity of biological parents. \"In some institutions there were 'acting mothers' who were paid to pretend to be the biological parents while handing them over,\" he said. In the documentary locals allege that some hospital workers worked alongside the networks. Some new mothers at a hospital in Matugama, western Sri Lanka, were reportedly told their children had died, when they were actually sold abroad for adoption. One woman told the documentary makers she was paid 2,000 rupees (\u00a323; $30) by someone connected to the hospital to act as a baby's mother. Many mothers had come to the western coastal city of Negombo from all over Sri Lanka in search for answers. They had heard of a visiting group trying to find their missing children. They had barely any documents. One mother had a picture of her child taken in 1989, but had no other information on the child's adoptive family or location. One mother told me she checked the adoption papers of her daughter and found all the information to be false. It seemed that a \"fake mother\" had been produced in court for the adoption. Another woman confessed to have accepted money to claim she was the mother of a girl. She said she did it as she was desperate for cash. Only mothers had showed up, not fathers. Most of the women said they had to give up their babies for adoption because their husbands had abandoned them in the first place. In Sri Lanka, we often hear about happy reunions of Dutch adoptees and Sri Lankan parents in newspapers. But after talking to these mothers it became clear there could have been a massive scandal in the '80s and '90s. Sri Lanka temporarily banned intra-country adoptions in 1987 when one \"baby farm\" was raided, and 20 newborns were found inside. Reports from the time said the women there were being held in \"prisonlike conditions\", surrounded by a 10 ft (3m) wall. Sri Lankan Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne denied the government held any responsibility or knowledge of the networks. But in an interview with the documentary makers he said he would look into setting up a special office to try to match the children involved. \"It is very wrong, it is against human rights of those families - so that has to be investigated. I myself will take the responsibility for that investigation.\" One mother, Renuka Abeysinghe, told the BBC that her daughter was taken in 1992. \"I will be very happy if I meet her again. I gave her for adoption because we were poor and we didn't have a way to live. \"They told me they took her to Germany but we had no information after that.\" Another, Ms Sirimavathi said she was alone when she gave up her daughter. \"I don't have parents, and all my close relatives were abroad when I got my child. I didn't have anyone. I didn't have a place to stay, \" she said. \"I cried a lot when giving away the baby, still I am crying. \"My wish is to see her once, I don't want anything from her.\" The Dutch State Secretary for Security and Justice confirmed to Zembla he was looking into the allegations.

Bar Association president Udaya Rohan de Silva said they opposed the manner of the passage of the bill only. The BASL is of the stand that amendments can be done at the committee stage, but that there is a big difference between an amendment and the inclusion of considerable changes, he said. That amounts to an influencing of the supremacy of the law, he said, adding they had decided to make representations to the president and the prime minister over the matter. After getting to know of their decision, the prime minister arranged a meeting with party leaders, said de Silva. At the meeting, PM Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government was not opposed to holding the PC polls in January, and not in December as it would disrupt the GCE ordinary level examination, he said.

Geerte Piening, 23, was caught short after a night out drinking in Amsterdam's vibrant Leidseplein in 2015. It was past closing time and the nearest public toilet was a couple of kilometres away, so she decided to find a quiet street while her friends kept watch. She was caught by three police officers. \"At the time I really didn't want to get involved in a discussion,\" she said. \"But the next day I thought, just a minute, I'm going to fight this.\" The judge, in this case a man, told her she should have used one of the men's facilities rather than resorting to urinating in public - an offence known as \"wildplassen\" in Dutch. Using the word as a hashtag, some women mocked his suggestion and shared photos of themselves demonstrating the obvious difficulties involved in adapting to urinals. Unlike men, women have no discreet way of using the metal structures. The judge also likened the offence to throwing litter on the street rather than in a bin, prompting one commentator to point out that banana peels or chocolate bar wrappers could be stashed in a pocket and dumped at any point in a gender-neutral bin. 'Enormous feminist thing' Ms Piening insisted she had used the alleyway only as a last resort and said public facilities for women in other European capitals were far superior. \"Isn't it embarrassing for a tourist city like Amsterdam that women have nowhere to go?\" she told the AD newspaper, \"It wasn't my intention that this would become an enormous feminist thing. On the other hand, it's good it's being addressed.\" The judge acknowledged there were fewer facilities for women but said the council was not obliged to provide them. Women were less likely to use them anyway, he added, noting this was a rare case. \"You are only the second woman I've seen in court for this,\" he was quoted as saying. Amsterdam's city council said there had never been any policy on public toilets. \"There are more men's than women's just because that's how it's gone,\" Peter Paul Ekker, a spokesman for the deputy mayor, told the BBC. \"Obviously it should be equal and everyone will agree it can be done better, but what are the costs, is there space, and is it worth it?\" But this may not be the end of the story.

Elilan, who functioned as the Eastern Trincomalee district political leader of the the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), was taken into custody by the 58th brigade at Mulaitivu, the NPC minister maintained. On the final day of the judicial inquiry into the disappearance, Major General Chanakya Gunawardena of the Sri Lanka military informed the magistrate court in the north eastern town of Mullaitivu that the military had concluded that Elilan is not in military custody. Sri Lanka military has arrived at that conclusion after examining the list of Tamils who were released from detention following state rehabilitation. Therefore, Elilan was \"neither arrested, made to disappear or rehabilitated,\" said the Major General Gunawardena who is the present commander of the 58th Brigade. Upon cross questioning, he confirmed that the military did not carry out any further investigations to find out the senior LTTE leader. The lawyer representing Ananthy Sasitharan denounces the commander's statement as irresponsible. Following the hearing, attorney at law KS Ratnavale told journalists in Sri Lanka that the response of the military commander displays \"callous disregard to the life of a human being who has disappeared\". Minister Sasitharan vowed to carry on with the struggle to find the fate of her husband whom she \"gave to the military with my own hands while tens of thousands were looking on\". \"This is not only about me and my husband,\" she told journalists after the hearing. \"This is about justice for thousands of Tamils who are enduring years of untold suffering.\" Mullativu magistrate MSM Samsudeen referred the findings of the judicial investigation to the Vavunia high court for further hearing on 9 November. An international human rights organisation have recorded testimonies from witness alleging Brigadier Shavendra Silva who led the 58th brigade of receiving LTTE leaders who surrendered. LTTE political wing leader Balasingham Nadesan and Peace Secretary Seevaratnam Pulithevan have been among those who approached the military with white flags. JDS has credible evidence published in several international media outlets, that Balachandran, the son of LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and female rebel journalist Isaipriya who were in Sri Lanka military custody were later found executed. Family members whose loved ones have disappeared during the war and its aftermath have been continuing with their protests in the north for the seventh month demanding answers. The UN among many other rights bodies have criticised the military rehabilitation programme as an arbitrary and discriminatory form of detention with torture.

{"topic": "Ensure trade union rights of journalists", "full_news": "There is going to be an \"Open Media Workshop\" for journalists in Colombo, on 25 September organised by the State agency, the \"SL Media Training Institute\" that comes under the Media Ministry. Improving reporting skills is said to be the purpose of the workshop. It is appreciated such training is undertaken by this State agency, when universities and other training institutes have for more than 03 decades failed to produce working journalists of professional quality. Sri Lanka does need high quality professionalism in media that lacks basics. Media is talked of as the hallmark of democracy in this modern world. Democracy sans free media is no functional democracy. While professionalism is ignored, we are told the media in Sri Lanka enjoys freedom of expression. With the advent of the present \"yahapalana\" unity government, the pressures and threats there was during the Rajapaksa regime is no more. This media freedom said to be without interference by the government and the State is a total fake. Media lacks ethics, even to the extent of honouring the 'Code of Ethics' \"The Editors' Guild\" formulated over 02 decades ago for themselves and journalists. By now, even the Editors don't respect their own 'Code of Ethics'. Media freedom without ethics and professionalism is no media freedom the society needs for informative, intellectual engagement in a democratic society. Quality professional and ethical media practise requires conditions beyond training. There can be no ethics and professionalism in an industry that does not recognise the independence of journalists. In today's media, journalists do not know what their fundamental rights are and do not demand those rights as even FTZ workers do. Without independent journalists who are conscious of their own rights, there will be no professionalism and independence necessary for an independent media, however much they are trained. All employees in Sri Lanka including journalists are entitled to the fundamental right to association guaranteed under the Constitution. The Constitution under 14(1)(c) says \"every citizen is entitled to the freedom of association\" and then under 14(1)(d) says \"every citizen is entitled to the freedom to form and join a trade union\", a right no private media allow their employees including journalists. It is the private media that dominates and impacts, having leased a major share of airwaves and also running their own print media. It is surprising and saddening too, politicians who depend very much on media coverage don't ever talk about journalists' rights. It is far more serious when the Labour Department that is mandated to ensure these basic rights to employees does not do so in private companies that own media. No government has done so either, while Sri Lanka is a signatory to ILO Core Conventions and has ratified them too. ILO Conventions 87 and 98 hold governments responsible in ensuring the right of employees to \"form trade unions of their choice\" and also to ensure \"collective bargaining\". This present \"yahapalana\" government is now held answerable to the EU Trade Commission as well in ensuring human and labour rights, with EU GSP \"Plus\" benefits provided once again with a promise to abide by those conditions. As such, it is now the responsibility of the Media Minister to ensure, journalists and all media workers are allowed the right to form and join trade unions of their choice and owners of both print and electronic media accept and recognise trade unions. It is also the responsibility of journalists to first demand their own fundamental rights, while covering issues and rights of the people. It is time they demand the right to form trade unions for that collective presence alone would ensure media freedom and independence of the media.

Bangladesh also announced plans to build shelters for up to 400,000 people near the city of Cox's Bazar. The mainly Muslim Rohingyas have been fleeing a Myanmar government offensive since last month, which the UN says could amount to ethnic cleansing. But the army says it is responding to attacks by militants and denies it is targeting civilians. Meanwhile, Amnesty International says it can reveal new evidence pointing to a mass-scale scorched-earth campaign across northern Rakhine State, where Myanmar security forces and vigilante mobs are burning down entire Rohingya villages and shooting people at random as they try to flee. The AI says the organization\u2019s analysis of active fire-detection data, satellite imagery, photographs and videos from the ground, as well as interviews with dozens of eyewitnesses in Myanmar and across the border in Bangladesh, shows how an orchestrated campaign of systematic burnings has targeted Rohingya villages across northern Rakhine State for almost three weeks. The Rohingya, a stateless mostly Muslim minority in Buddhist-majority Rakhine, have long experienced persecution in Myanmar, which says they are illegal immigrants. The Sri Lankan government is yet to make an official stand known with regard to this issue. Foreign affairs state minister Wasantha Senanayake has told BBC Sinhala Service that Sri Lankan\u2019s stand was that all countries should act democratically and ensure the rights of all their citizens. As a friendly country, Sri Lanka wants Myanmar not to be isolated internationally over this matter, and the way out is through negoations, he said. Asked about his comments as to why Aung San Suu Kyi is not acting over this issue, he said she was yet to have full powers, although she was a heroine who worked for her country\u2019s independence. The US secretary of state has urged Myanmar to treat all its citizens equally, while the UN secretary general condemned the violence there. Senanayake said Sri Lanka agreed with their demand for an immediate halt to the violence, and reiterated that international-isolation would turn countries violent, taking North Korea as a case in point. He said there could be \u2018hidden forces\u2019 behind the Myanmar crisis. In Colombo and at Katankudy, Oddamawadi, Akkarapattu and Kinniya in the eastern province, protests took place against attacks of the Rohingyas. Around 30 Rohingyas who fled Myanmar arrived in Sri Lanka and are being kept under UNHCR care at a house at Mt. Lavinia following a court order, said their lawyer Shiraz Noordeen. Noordeen said the Sri Lankan foreign ministry has signed an expression of interest with the UN with regard to these people. He expressed hope the UN would send the Rohingya people to another country, in the same manner it acted when 138 Rohingyas came to the island two years ago.

{"topic": "Mahinda\u2019s statement on \u2018sil redi\u2019 project", "full_news": "Many people including the media have asked me about this matter and I feel I should make my views known to the public, he says. The former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga and the former Director General of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Anusha Pelpita were declared guilty by the High Court under Section 386 of the Penal Code of \u2018dishonestly misappropriating\u2019 a sum of Rs. 600 million belonging to the TRC by remitting the said sum to a bank account of the Presidential Secretariat to be used for the purpose of distributing sil redi during the last Presidential elections. They have each been sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment, a fine of Rs. two million and either the payment of Rs 50 million in compensation to the TRC or a further two years of rigorous imprisonment. Many people including the media have asked me about this matter and I feel I should make my views known to the public. To say that this conviction and sentence has shocked the country would be an understatement. The judgement itself states that neither Lalith Weeratunga nor Anusha Pelpita had appropriated for their personal use any of the money used to purchase sil redi. From my point of view, they only carried out legitimate instructions issued to them by the President of the country. The verbal instructions given by me in this regard have been recorded in the form of minutes placed by Mr Weeratunga on correspondence with officials of the Presidential Secretariat. On 20 March 2014, Mr Weeratunga wrote a minute to the Senior Assistant Secretary of the Presidential Secretariat outlining eight projects that I had ordered funded through the President\u2019s Special Development Fund during the year 2014. The sixth item on this list was providing \u2018material aid\u2019 to the devotees observing sil at temples on Poya days. The other projects on the list included funding for the IT section of the Kotelawala Defence University and assistance to construct houses for low income earners in the former \u2018border villages\u2019 etc. On 12 May 2014, in yet another minute to the Senior Assistant Secretary Mr Weeratunga had stated that I had given instructions that sil redi be distributed to devotees observing sil on Poya days. This was long before the declaration of the presidential election. The purpose of the President\u2019s Special Development Fund which had an annual budget of Rs. 1,000 million and was started in 2012, was to fill the gaps left by other ministries and to meet requests made directly to the President. The Coordinating Secretary for Religious Affairs of the Presidential Secretariat Ven. Watinapaha Somananda Thera was in charge of implementing the sil redi project. At the latter\u2019s request, the Economic Affairs Ministry carried out a survey through Samurdhi Niladharis to identify the requirements of sil redi at temples countrywide. The suppliers were instructed to hand over the sil redi to a main temple in each Divisional Secretariat area from where they would be distributed to other temples. This was a project implemented countrywide, involving 11,021 temples. This was aid supplied to the temples, not to voters. After the sil redi reached the temples, the Chief Incumbent monk became the sole authority who could decide when, how, and to whom the sil redi would be distributed. No time frame was imposed on the temples to carry out the distribution. They could have been distributed either immediately or even a year later at the discretion of the Chief Incumbent of the temple. The mode of distribution did not enable the beneficiaries to be selected on political grounds. School uniforms are also distributed towards the end of the year and cannot be withheld even if an election was on. Nobody would suggest that the receipt of school uniforms during an election would influence the result of the election. The sil redi was also general state aid distributed across the board to Buddhist devotees just like the school uniforms. In fact the suppliers of school uniforms to the government had been mobilised for the sil redi project as well. The sil redi was not meant just for adults of voting age but for daham pasal students observing sil on Poya days as well. It was stated in the judgement that the sil redi parcels contained a label which read \u201cMahinda Rajapaksa methithuman Mahinda Chinthana prathipaththi walata anuwa yamin karana daham pandurak\u201d. (A religious offering made by Mahinda Rajapaksa in pursuance of Mahinda Chintanaya policies.) This was only a label stating the provenance of the sil redi, and in any event, is not in violation of Sections 72 and 68(1)(e) of the Presidential Elections Act No:15 of 1981, which deal with the display of printed matter during elections. Section 77 of the Presidential Elections Act on \u2018treating\u2019 voters, also does not apply to this case because the sil redi was handed over to temples without any time frame for distribution and were provided to all regardless of the political affiliation of the temples and the devotees. Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Pelpita were never charged for election related offences even though this is being portrayed as a case relating to the misuse of public property during election time. Under Section 164(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the charges brought against the accused have to clearly state the law under which the offence said to have been committed, is punishable. The reason why money had to be obtained for this project from the TRC is because on 14 October 2014, the Chief Accountant of the Presidential Secretariat sent Lalith Weeratunga a note stating that the allocation of the President\u2019s Special Development Fund for the year 2014 was Rs. 1,000 million and that Rs. 400 million of this had to be given to a project of the Kotelawala Defence University and that there was insufficient funds for the sil redi project. Lalith Weeratunga replied to this with a minute on 15 October 2014 instructing the Chief Accountant to release the money to the Kotelawala Defence University and that the money for the sil redi project will be obtained from the TRC to be reimbursed later. Mr Weeratunga had written to the Director General of the TRC on 30 October 2014, stating that it had been decided to obtain financial patronage (mulya anugrahaya) for this project from the TRC. Thereupon, Anusha Pelpita Director General of the TRC had prepared a board paper for this purpose on the same day seeking the approval of the board, (a) to allocate Rs. 600 million to the Corporate Social Responsibility budget of the TRC as an extra budgetary allocation, (b) to approve the donation of Rs. 600 million to the President\u2019s Special Development Fund and (c) to spend this amount from the corporate social responsibility budget of the TRC. This paper had been presented to the TRC board meeting held on 15 December 2014 and all three proposals had been unanimously approved by the Commission. The money from the TRC had been remitted to the Presidential Secretariat account on 5 December 2014. On 29 December 2014, Lalith Weeratunga sent a note to the Chief Accountant stating that the money from the TRC should be reimbursed as soon as the allocation for 2015 is received and that at least Rs. 200 million should be paid back in the first quarter of 2015. According to Section 22F(3) of the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act No: 25 of 1991 as amended by Act No: 27 of 1996, the board of directors of the TRC can authorise any payment in the performance of its tasks. Sections 218, 115, 65, 66, 68, 93 and 94 of the Financial Regulations of the Government of Sri Lanka also authorises \u2018Chief Accounting Officers\u2019 (who in the case of the Presidential Secretariat was Lalith Weeratunga) to transfer money between government agencies under his authority on the basis of reimbursement. Regrettably, the written evidence presented to courts in the form of Lalith Weeratunga\u2019s minutes giving instructions to the Chief Accountant or the Senior Assistant Secretary of the Presidential Secretariat in relation to this project have not been considered in the judgement delivered by the High Court. The prosecution brought 21 witnesses to prove their case against the accused. The High Court has not taken into account the evidence provided by prosecution witness No: 13 Hewage Emali Priyanthara, No: 20 Ruwani Saumya Gunaratne, No: 15 Rev. Watinapaha Somananda Thero, No: 04 Saputhanthrige Chandra Jagath, No: 14 Mallika Kanakanamlage Jayantha and prosecution witness No: 5 Amarasinghe Lekamge Don Gunaratne (the Chief Accountant of the Presidential Secretariat) on the grounds that they had worked with the accused in the Presidential Secretariat and the TRC and were also connected to the sil redi project and that they had been partial (lediyawak) or sympathetic to the accused. These were witnesses called by the prosecution - not the defence - and their evidence had been provided to courts under oath. This has very serious implications for state employees at all levels. If for example an employee of the Customs Department is taken to courts for allegedly violating procedure, the only way to prove or disprove that such a violation took place is through written and verbal evidence from within the Customs Department itself. If in such cases, even the testimony of witnesses brought by the prosecution is not taken into account on the grounds that they had worked with the accused and were therefore partial, the accused government servant will have no defence at all. Another matter of grave concern in the case of Lalith Weeratunga, is that the handwritten instructions given by the highest State official in the land to his subordinates have not been considered by the courts. If this becomes a precedent, no State employee charged in a court of law will ever be able to prove his innocence. The unanimous approval of Anusha Pelpita\u2019s board paper by the TRC board of directors on 15 December 2014 has also not been taken into account in a situation where the authority with exclusive power to utilise the funds of the TRC is the TRC board of directors. This will have serious implications for all private sector and state sector bodies that are run by boards of directors. The severe sentence imposed on Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Pelpita is not because they enriched themselves through corrupt means but because they carried out the instructions of the head of state to distribute sil redi to temples in pursuance of the government\u2019s obligations under Article 9 of the Constitution to foster and protect Buddhism. Under our constitution, the direction and control of the government is the responsibility of the cabinet of ministers (including the President) and the public service is expected to work in good faith to achieve the policy objectives of the government. Therefore public servants who carry out lawful instructions issued to them by the President and the Cabinet should be protected if there are no serious allegations of corruption against them.", "intro": "", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/4881-mahinda-s-statement-on-sil-redi-project"},

{"topic": "DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr facing parliamentary inquiry over", "full_news": "Ian Paisley Jr said he had referred himself to Kathryn Hudson, the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, following this newspaper's disclosure that he accepted two all-expenses-paid trips to Sri Lanka. The announcement followed concern raised by MPs that the DUP parliamentarian might be helping to broker a \u201cback-door trade agreement\u201d with the country. Transparency International, the campaign group, said Mrs Hudson should investigate the matter as a \"top priority\", following concerns that Mr Paisley has failed to declare the trips in the Commons register of interests. The Telegraph can disclose that the holidays were organised by a highly controversial Sri Lankan official who has since become embroiled in a case brought by the country's Corruption Commission, whose charges he describes as \"frivolous\". Sajin De Vass Gunawardena, who in a 2011 interview jokingly told how he had been described as a \"rogue, thief and a corrupt person\", hosted Mr Paisley at a dinner in London in January 2013. Following the dinner Mr Paisley wrote in an email seen by the Telegraph: \"Dear Sajin, Many thanks for your hospitality on Wednesday evening. I had a wonderful time ... It was great to meet with your bother and all your colleagues and to really feel part of a new family of friends.\" He added: \"Given family commitments and school holidays would it be possible to visit between 30th March returning 6th April.\" Documents seen by the Telegraph show that Mr Paisley subsequently took his wife and children to the country for luxury holidays in 2013. This week Mr Paisley posted a picture of himself alongside the Sri Lankan high commissioner, with the caption: \u201cWith Sri Lanka high commissioner to discuss NI-Sri Lanka trade deal after Brexit.\u201d Two days after the meeting in Parliament, Mr Paisley posted a picture of himself alongside Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, with whom he discussed \"our trade agreements post Brexit\". Mr Paisley initially declined to answer a series of questions about the Telegraph's findings, including discussions he had with Mr Gunawardena about a potential oil deal. But on Friday he said:\u00a0 \"I can categorically state that I have never brokered any oil deal for this gentleman or anyone else.\" He also tweeted a statement from his lawyer saying: \"My client totally denies the defamatory inferences arising from the article in today's Daily Telegraph including those relating to his registration obligations as an MP. He has now referred this matter, and a full explanation, to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.\" Ian Paisley Jr denies \u00a3100,000 Sri Lanka holiday claim One of the Democratic Unionist MPs whose votes prop up Theresa May\u2019s government has denied allegations that he took \u00a3100,000 worth of hospitality from the Sri Lankan government. Ian Paisley Jr, the MP for North Antrim, has referred himself to a Westminster watchdog committee after allegations that he did not declare two all-expenses-paid holidays to the country in 2013. The Daily Telegraph reported that Paisley Jr had recently met Sri Lankan officials to discuss possible post-Brexit trade deals. Paisley Jr said the report in the Telegraph was both \u201cdevoid of logic or fact\u201d and defamatory. He said on Twitter that he had reported the article to his lawyer. He later tweeted an image of a letter from his solicitor Paul Tweed denying the claims: A DUP spokesman said: \u201cIan Paisley MP will rightly refer himself to the parliamentary commissioner for standards. We await the outcome of that investigation.\u201d The House of Commons code of conduct states that MPs must declare any visit to a destination outside the UK which \u201crelates in any way to their membership of the house or to their parliamentary or political activities\u201d and which costs more than \u00a3300, unless they have paid for it themselves or out of parliamentary or party funds. The rules state the MPs do not have to register family holidays, so long as they are \u201cwholly unconnected with membership of the house or with the member\u2019s parliamentary or political activities\u201d. Entries in the register of members\u2019 interests should cover the cost of travel, hotels, meals, hospitality and car hire, and repeat visits should be registered if their combined value comes to more than \u00a3300. Paisley\u2019s register entries include a trade mission to Sri Lanka in 2012, as well as a second trip to the island that year as part of a cross-party delegation to examine post-war reconstruction, which received funding of \u00a33,200 from the Colombo government. There is no mention of the alleged trips in 2013. Complaints over alleged breaches of the code are investigated by the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Hudson, who reports to the Commons standards committee. This committee, made up of MPs and lay members, has the power to recommend sanctions, such as requiring an apology or temporary suspension, subject to a vote in the Commons. Paisley Jr, 50, is the son of the late Rev Ian Paisley, who founded the DUP in the early 1970s. He is one of 10 DUP MPs whose votes in the House of Commons help to keep the minority Conservative government in power. The price for the DUP\u2019s support has been a \u00a31bn-plus aid package for Northern Ireland. In 2010, Paisley Jr succeeded his father as MP for North Antrim.

{"topic": "Decriminalize Abortion in Sri Lanka: Statement by human rights", "full_news": "Currently, abortion is criminalized in Sri Lanka completely, unless it can be proven that it is necessary to save the life of the woman.2 This means women cannot access legal and safe abortions. Around 700 abortions are performed daily in Sri Lanka3, which also accounts for the second leading cause of maternal deaths in 2006, 2008 and 20104. Criminalization of abortion has only driven the practice underground, with women resorting to illegal and often unsafe abortions5. The Country Profile on Universal Access to Sexual and Reproductive Health: Sri Lanka (2015)6 states, \u2018Maternal death due to septic abortion is the third highest cause for maternal death, at 13% (FHB, 2012).\u2019 It also states, \u2018However, considering the...data, its legal status does not prevent women from seeking abortions, but does prevent women from seeking immediate medical assistance when complications occur... patients are brought in when the conditions are severe and are also at risk of being charged for procuring illegal abortions.\u2019\u2019 The CEDAW Committee also expressed concern that in Sri Lanka, abortion is still a punishable offence under the law, unless the purpose is to save the life of the mother, and expressed regrets that about 10 per cent of maternal mortality is reported as the direct result of clandestine abortion. In its Concluding Observations on the Eighth Periodic Report, the Committee reiterated its recommendation to the State to decriminalize abortion .  The continued criminalization of abortion is a crisis for women\u2019s rights, women\u2019s health and wellbeing in Sri Lanka; it is as a serious obstacle to our ability to make empowered and autonomous decisions as equal citizens. To choose the termination of an unwanted pregnancy, under any circumstances, is a fundamental human right. We are concerned about the \u2018religious\u2019 and moralistic framework given to this debate by some opponents of decriminalization8. We assert that this is not a moral or religious matter, it is a matter of women\u2019s human rights, dignity and choice. A response to this debate must be a response to women primarily, regardless of class, caste and circumstance. This call to legalize abortion is not a moral one - it is a position which centers the decision-making power of women, and sees the need to reform outdated, colonial legislation, so that women\u2019s rights and autonomy can be enjoyed in full. We will continue to campaign and work towards decriminalization of abortion unconditionally. At this juncture we support the cabinet\u2019s decision to ease the existing laws criminalizing abortion and we ask the state not to be swayed in this decision. 1. We urge the government to promote, protect and fulfill all the rights of all women, and to fulfill its responsibility towards its citizens. Significant decisions such as this, with regards to citizens\u2019 rights should not be influenced by religious or other institutions, in a secular and democratic state such as ours. 2. We urge the government strongly, to support the proposed amendments to existing abortion legislation and to continue to work with public health officials, women\u2019s rights advocates, medical professions, and psychological-support experts to decriminalize abortion without limitation, and provide women the right and access to safe and legal abortion services. 3. We strongly urge the government to acknowledge every woman\u2019s right to autonomously make decisions with regards to her own body, health and wellbeing -- physiological and emotional - unconditionally. 1.

It not only gives you the convenience of charging your SUV in your driveway but also guarantees comfort, safety and durability. The innovative Plug-in Hybrid EV system that powers the Outlander PHEV delivers remarkable eco efficiency without compromising comfort, performance or convenience. Including full leather seat upholstery, electric sunroof, a keyless operation system, multi-function leather steering wheel as well as the twin motor 4WD system with lock mode, the Outlander is a full-option SUV. Safety wise the Outlander comes with 7-air bags and stability control to ensure smooth driving even in the roughest terrain. Listen to your favourite tunes while cruising along with the premium audio system that is also specially designed for the Outlander PHEV itself. With a current global market share of 18%, one of the main factors that have made the Outlander PHEV one of the most sought after vehicles globally is its technology. The twin motor 4WD performance makes for easy handling, while the 2.0 litre engine is highly efficient with the high performance generator that transforms engine power into electricity to recharge the drive battery and assist the motors when needed. The battery is stored under the floor to maximize interior space and lower the centre of gravity for improved safety and handling. In the electric driving mode, the vehicle uses only electricity from the battery, resulting in zero fuel consumption and zero CO2 emissions. This drive mode is quiet, clean and powerful with a maximum speed limit of 120 km/h. In the hybrid driving mode on the other hand, the motors power the vehicle using engine-generated electricity. The engine generates electricity when the battery level is low and to increase power when accelerating rapidly or climbing hills. The switch between the two systems is at a simple push of a button. United Motors markets the Outlander PHEV export model with added benefits to Sri Lankan vehicle owners like the modified charging sockets that fits local electricity fluctuations, acclimatized design to suit local weather and road conditions. With a warranty of 4 years / 100,000kms, the Outlander PHEV is available from United Motors outlets in Colombo, Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Kurunegala, Ratnapura, Matara and Kandy.

Vaidyaratne. He said parts of the body had been sent for analysis and until the investigations are concluded, a definite verdict cannot be issued regarding the cause of death. Dr. Vaidyaratne further stated that there were no visible wounds on the body of the victim and they had not found any signs of other diseases either. However, according to Bhoomi Harendran of the \u2018Young Out There\u2019 organisation, although the victim was publicly known as a transvestite, he was actively involved in educating the transvestite community on HIV. \u201cShe has played a pivotal role as a Peer Educator on HIV/Aids in the peer education system, where she shared her knowledge among friends and others,\u201d explained Harendran. In reporting the killing of this transvestite, many media organisations described the victim as a person who was known to the police as a male during the day and roamed the streets at night dressed as a woman. However, had he/she been engaged in active education on transvestite health, why was his identity concealed? \u201cIn fact people look at this issue in a very narrow angle. We must understand how difficult it is to live in Sri Lankan society as a transvestite,\u201d said Harendran. Expressing similar views Professor Mayura Samarakone, Head of the Sri Jayawardenapura University, Social Science unit, he too was unaware of the circumstances and issues of the transgender community. \u201cFor example, there was a young man who joined our course and he presented his educational documents which stated that he had attended a girl\u2019s school. We were perplexed at this point,\u201d Professor Samarakone explained. \u201cWe were unaware as to how we should behave in such a situation, but later we rectified this issue,\u201d he confessed. The Professor expressed his views on the news reports titled \u201cPerson dressed in female clothing\u201d. \u201cToday there is no investigative reporting in this country but a popular media culture. Within this frame we find a certain uneducated ignorant nature.\u201d He said, apart from merely highlighting their ignorance with regard to these transgender persons, the media pays no attention to the issues faced by these transgender persons in our society neither making any effort to educate the public regarding their plight,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, transgender activist Bhoomi Harendran said it is no secret as to the number of transvestite sex workers engaged in the sex industry. \u201cThese persons are chased out from their homes at a very young age or they are not given jobs due to their sexual orientation.
