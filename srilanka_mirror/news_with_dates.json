Addressing the function the Minister said, \u201c Every electorate receives the same development opportunities under the Gamperaliya programme. Every District Secretariat Division receives a grant of Rs. 200 million for the next few months of the year alone. In the next budget more funds would be allocated for your village development. It is through this programme that the highest allocations were made for the development of rural villages under a short period. I am not someone who likes to lay foundation stones. I have come to know that there were many foundation stones laid for this project in the past. Earlier the people were hoodwinked on the pretext of carrying out development. The previous regime spent billions on roads in Hambantota where not even several vehicle travel on. Within two hours not even three vehicle ply on these roads. Yet those rulers did not pay attention to the tanks that were filled with silt. This is the difference in the development of today and the past. Although we have allocated Rs. 200 million for every DS division, if the money is insufficient for a project we would certainly make additional allocations. Under the Gamperaliya programme by the end of the year there won\u2019t be any thatched roofed homes in the villages. There won\u2019t be any home without electricity. The people would be able to see a true developmental change under the Gamperaliya programme,\u201d the minister said.

A committee comprising the ministries of justice, foreign affairs, health, law and order, attorney general\u2019s department, NPC etc. implements the programme.

They include the exclusion of leniency in consideration of previous conduct, enforcement of disciplinary laws against accused police officers, not granting the accused any promotion until gets cleared and keeping a watch list of the accused. Sumanadasa also said the NPC is having an independent investigation unit that investigates allegations of torture and refers the investigations to the IGP who will file action under criminal law. The NPC will make a post review of each and every case, he said. The NPC is having directors at provincial level, to whom complaints of torture could be referred by email, fax, or by letter to the NPC. The complainant is informed within seven days about the action taken regarding the complaint. According to him, the NPC received less than 10 complaints in the past three years, unlike the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission (SLHRC) that reportedly received a large number of complaints. Under the new programme, details of accused police officers will be brought under a single list, said the chief investigator.

The Bank's interest income grew by 9.6% YoY, outpacing the 5.6% growth reported in interest expenses resulting in a 15.3% YoY increase in NII to Rs. 22.0 billion for the period under review. Net Fee and Commission income continues to supplement core banking, contributing 15.9% of the Total Operating Income, increasing by 8.8% YoY to Rs. 4.4 billion largely driven by the growth in the Credit Card income and Trade Finance. Net losses on trading increased by 61.7% YoY to Rs. 1.4 billion during the first half of 2018 on account of higher depreciation of the LKR against USD compared to the corresponding period of 2017. However, the positive impact on revaluation propelled Other Operating Income to Rs. 2.7 billion which is a 103.6% YoY increase. The banking industry is witnessing a sharp increase in NPAs with significant collection and debt recovery difficulties experienced across the country. The agriculture sector continues to underperform due to adverse weather conditions while the construction sector is saddled with long delays in payments. In this backdrop, HNB's NPA ratio increased to 2.91% as at the end of June 2018 albeit remaining below the industry average which deteriorated to 3.3% for the period. Accordingly, the total impairment charge increased to Rs. 1.9 billion for 1H 2018, principally on account of the increase in collective impairment charge to Rs. 1.6 billion. The impairment cost on individually significant loans however, declined by 42.1% YoY to Rs. 342.3 billion. The continuous focus on operational excellence, process reengineering and digitalization efforts to improve productivity enabled the continuing improvement in the cost to income ratio to 37.7%, compared to 41.4% reported during 1H2017. The Bank's PBT grew by 25.2% YoY to Rs. 12.6 billion during 1H 2018 as compared to the 1H 2017. The impact of the changes effected in the new Inland Revenue Act resulted in an increase of 36.7% in income tax for the period with the total effective tax rate, including financial VAT and NBT increasing to 44.4% for the period. The resulting PAT of Rs. 8.6 billion represented a ROA of 1.76% and ROE of 15.54% for 1H 2018. The Group recorded a ROA of 1.85%, compared to 1.61% recorded in the commensurate period of 2017. The Bank's asset base grew by 4.8% during the first six months of the year to cross the Rs. 1 trillion mark. A robust 8.9% growth in the loan book since December 2017 boosted net loans to Rs. 695.7 billion, while deposits grew by 5.7% to Rs. 741.2 billion.

In the past Sri Lanka has sold up to 1.5 billion US dollars in bonds in a single offering. The sovereign bond is expected to go market early this year, before the Fed raises rates again. Sri Lanka's last issued sovereign bond is also trading around 60 basis points narrower, and rating agencies have already given an outlook upgrade. Sri Lanka was agnostic about the denominating currency, and was open to selling a Samurai or Panda bond after the dollar sovereign bond if the cost and tenor is right, Coomaraswamy said. Sri Lanka is expected to pass a liability management law shortly which will allow the Treasury to sell more bonds than needed for debt repayment in a given year, to build a buffer to ride out a peak coming later. A Samurai bond would allow Sri Lanka to tap into the Japanese bond market, while a Panda bond would allow Sri Lanka to enter the Chinese capital market. Sri Lanka operates a 'de facto' soft-peg which generally depreciates uni-directionally against the US dollar generating high inflation. The currency collapses steeply whenever the central bank resists market interest rates by printing money, when the credit cycle turns strongly positive. Due to operating a de facto dollar peg, there is also a currency risk in borrowings denominated in a currency other than the US dollar. The Renminbi is also partially pegged to the US dollar, but it has shown a tendency to appreciate when the US Fed generates higher levels of inflation. The Yen has weakened against the US dollar in recent years but is a floating rate with a very low interest rates. Market analysts say it would be possible to sell a Samurai bond with a currency swap at a lower rate than a euro dollar bond of a similar maturity.

The CPCs are well established organizational structures under the Sri Lanka Police with the active participation and help of the Ministry of Public Administration & Management and Law & Order. There are 14068 Community Policing Committees currently operating, covering all the GN divisions Island-wide. These committees were originally established to enlist the help of villages to ensure village security during the conflict. CPCs currently focus on Drug Prevention, Prevention of Child Abuse and Sexual Violence, and Dengue Prevention activities. In terms of the Administration Circular No.11/2016 dated 23rd September 2016, CPC's, in furtherance of their national security objective, are required to be vigilant on any threats to national security, conduct programs promoting communal and religious harmony and establish a communication network. Accordingly, Sri Lanka police officials have agreed to run a project to strengthen the capacities of CPC's through the community engaging dialogue series in order to serve as a grassroots engagement platform to convey the government's reconciliation agenda and its achievements, using a tried and true existing grassroots structure; CPC to serve as a feedback mechanism to obtain ideas on decisions the government proposes to enact, and has enacted and to avoid the spreading of racism and misinformation at the village level, thus preventing conflict and contributing to reconciliation at both the local and national levels. These goals would be achieved partly by discussing the government's reconciliation agenda with local villagers and village leaders and by reporting the results of this discussion to the relevant authorities in the government and partly by giving a large number of stakeholders across the country a platform to engage in constructive debate, which will lead to the inculcation of a better, more informed, progressive population. The MoU is expected to build a team of peacemakers at district and/or divisional secretariat level to promote the national unity, reconciliation and coexistence dialogue of the Government of Sri Lanka. The peacemakers will be used as resource persons in village level CPC meetings. For this training, a group of fifty five (55) officers from and amongst Public Relation Officers and the Officers in Charge of the Community Policing Units will be selected per province.

{"topic": "Improved infrastructure plays major role in real estate values \u2013", "date": "Aug 06, 2018", "full_news": "Construction of the LRT is scheduled to commence as early as 2020 at a cost of USD1.7 billion - funded by Japanese government loans, and re-payable over 40 years, at 0.1% interest, and with a 12-year initial grace period. The first line -travelling from Fort/Pettah to Malabe- is projected to begin commercial operations in 2024 and promises a considerably reduced travel time of approximately 30 minutes between the two termini. Phase 1 is reported to be fully elevated, with a total of 16 stops over the 15.3 km length of the line. As is expected, with any major commercial development promising to bring with it added convenience and ease of travel, property prices en route are expected to spike. In an attempt to assess the impact of the projected LRT terminal on real estate values, JLL Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. has considered both, history, and global case studies, for similar infrastructure improvements, in other geographies around the world -namely those in cities such as London and Dubai. The correlation between real estate values and improved infrastructure is not a new phenomenon, and it was in London with the opening of the first Metropolitan underground line in 1863, that this was first observed. Infrastructure has subsequently become the lifeblood of prosperity and confidence, driving sustainability, and, by upgrading inadequate systems, removing transport bottlenecks, with significant lifestyle improvements for those who benefit. However, with half the world\u2019s population now living in urban areas, and, this set to increase by 50%, from 4 billion to 6 billion, over the next 15 years, the speed and scale of urbanization poses enormous challenges for local governments. Closer to home in the monocentric city of Colombo, the urban population currently accounts for approximately 48% of the total population which is projected to increase to 72% by 2033. This rapid pace of urbanization underscores the need for discovering alternate channels to leverage the city\u2019s workforce and increase efficiency, thereby improving the standard of living of its citizens on par with the rest of the world\u2019s leading metropolises. However, in the case of Colombo where commercial activity is restricted to a single CBD, the pressure on existing infrastructure is more intense, and the cost of construction and disruption during the construction phase is much higher. As a result, sustainability is driving urban planners to move towards a polycentric model, where cities have multiple commercial sub centres -perhaps best illustrated in the model of new cities, such as Dubai, which in addition to the Sheikh Zayed/DIFC CBD, has numerous sub commercial hubs including Business Bay, The Marina, Jumeirah Lakes and Jebel Ali. If Colombo is to alleviate chronic congestion issues and move towards a more sustainable, environmentally friendly, polycentric model with the intention of improving living standards for residents and driving commercial efficiencies for businesses, an integrated LRT system will prove to be vital to these goals. The suburb of Malabe, according to online data, already enjoys projected, year on year, land price increases of 16%, with per perch prices already approaching LKR 1 million. This is partly due to good access to the southern expressway, and the proliferation of high tech IT and business parks providing excellent employment prospects for graduates from nearby educational institutions. In this evaluation, the Thunen Rings Principal -the first mathematical model to explain agricultural land values in relation to distance from population centres, developed by Johann Heinrich von Thunen in 1826- has proven useful. Developed further by the American, William Alonso, in 1960, to become the Bid Rent Theory, land values, in relation to distance from a CBD or major infrastructure improvement, can now be quantified. Slope A demonstrates that proximity to a major infrastructure improvement has less impact on the value of residential property, although the radius of influence is wider. Commercial property values rise higher than residential, although the radius of influence is narrower (slope B). In certain circumstances, where the infrastructure improvement may be a source of noise and air pollution, such as a major road, slope C demonstrates that there is an optimum distance from that source, for maximum value increase, too close and values may fall, due to adverse effects, too far and values begin to slide. There have been numerous global studies on the impact of infrastructure improvements on property values, each with its own host of factors that influence the outcome, but it appears that whether road or rail, and from such diverse geographies as Brazil, Sweden and Dubai, there is very close correlation demonstrating value increases of between 6 and 12%. An ideal example is London, and the M25 orbital motorway, which opened in 1986. Over the 30 year period, since its opening, real estate values, for property in its vicinity, have risen a staggering 551%, or an average of 6% per annum, compounded. Having stated this, it would still be prudent to consider two other interesting facts that emerge from such studies, that may influence a decision in investing in real estate where infrastructure developments are in the pipeline. Firstly, commercial real estate, and lands, benefit from higher rises than residential real estate when road and rail improvements are delivered. Secondly, and perhaps, even more importantly, rental rates rise more than sale values in the residential sector. Studies in Dubai have shown that property sale values, within 0.5km from Metro stations, actually fell, and the optimum distance for values to rise, was 1.0 to 1.5 km, while rental rates rose sharply for properties within a 0.5 km radius of these transport hubs. It can then be concluded that while there is more often than not a distinct correlation between improved infrastructure and property prices, there are other holistic factors to be considered that may just sway this relationship. Accordingly, owner/occupiers and buy to let investors would do well to conduct their own research before accepting sales pitches, that include price rise projections, at face value.", "intro": "With the recent announcement that the much-anticipated Colombo Light Rail Transit (LRT) project is all set to proceed with Phase 1 following the green light from government ministries, there has been widespread speculation on its effect on the price of property within close proximity to the line.

In July 2017, however, the ECJ confirmed an annulment of the continued freezing of the LTTE\u2019s funds between 2011 and 2015.

Vijitha Herath further noted that the MP salary increments takes place based on a proposal brought to parliament by former minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle during the Rajapaksa government in 2006.

The Speakers office confirmed that a discussion was on regarding the increment of MP wages. The national newspapers had noted that a 215% salary increment for MPs was being discussed and in response the Speaker\u2019s office issued a statement yesterday (03). The statement noted that based on a proposal passed in parliament on November 23, 2006, when the wages of high court judges increases, the wages of parliament ministers and MPs should also increase proportionately. The Speaker noted that accordingly, with the increase in judges\u2019 wages, he had received a proposal for the increment of MP salaries. \u00a0However, the Speaker\u2019s statement noted that no final decision had been taken so far with regard to the MP salary increments.

He said that the JO group leader Dinesh Gunawardena as well as the JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake had given their consent for the MP wage increase. He said this when contacted regarding the MP salary increment issue. The wages and allowances accorded to an MP is shown below.

{"topic": "Sri Lankan visa scam revealed ; no review of past", "date": "Jul 31, 2018", "full_news": "The New Zealand immigration office in Mumbai that handles Sri Lankan applications received a tip off at the start of the year. Inquiries led officials to conclude a Sri Lankan based finance company was fraudulently creating documentation to help students meet the criteria of having $15,000 in the bank. Official briefings to Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway show investigations are under way into the potential involvement of education agents in Sri Lanka, the finance company, whose name is redacted in the papers, and students as a result of these revelations. There were 88 pending applications when the fraud was discovered and after further checks were done 83 were declined. The tip-off was in January. Immigration Minister Iain-Lees Galloway said officials did not yet know how many fraudulent applications may have slipped through the net. There could potentially be hundreds of students here illegally, Mr Lees-Galloway said. \"So what Immigration New Zealand is doing is identifying the ones that have the potential to be fraudulent and I think are taking sensible action.\" However, he said officials were somewhat hamstrung in their ability to establish the authenticity of thousands of past applications. They were going through 895 applications that came from Sri Lanka through the Mumbai office, to identify which ones contained information from the \"fraudulent\" finance company, the minister said. \"And they would place a flag against those applications, those people still in New Zealand, in the event that they try to extend their visa and stay in New Zealand longer, closer scrutiny would be applied to those applications.\" The New Zealand government would not, however, be challenging any visas other than the original 88 when the fraud was discovered, Mr Lees-Galloway said. \"The challenge that Immigration New Zealand faces with trying to do this retrospectively is they rely on the finance company to provide the bona fide information when they're assessing an application,\" he said. \"Given this finance company has proved to be fraudulent it's a pointless exercise for Immigration New Zealand to go back to them and ask them to verify the information that they gave in the first place.\" Immigration New Zealand no longer dealt with that company, he said. Acting Prime Minister Winston Peters said he and the New Zealand public expected the immigration system to be robust, and for the minister and officials to uphold those expectations. But he accepted there could be significant numbers involved in this scam. \"I've go no doubt that is possible, but our job is to make sure it stops and we tidy up the processes.\" Meanwhile, the National Party wants to know why hundreds of past visas that have been granted to Sri Lankan students won't be reviewed. The papers said a number of New Zealand educational providers had been affected and they had been told about what had happened and warned about the impact of student numbers in the future. There was also an allegation \"students paid an additional fee to secure the documentation\" which was under further investigation. From 2015 to 2017 there were about 5000 student visa applications from Sri Lanka of which about 3800 were approved. The documents do not make it clear how long officials think the scam has been going on. Former Immigration Minister and National Party spokesperson Michael Woodhouse asked Mr Lees-Galloway whether he would look at past years to make sure the visas approved were legitimate. Mr Lees-Galloway said that after scrutinising, then rejecting, most of the 88 applications the focus would now be on any future signs of fraud. \"To identify applications with similar characteristics already decided by INZ [Immigration New Zealand] would require substantial collation which I do not believe is in the public interest.\" According to Mr Woodhouse, up to half of Sri Lankan applicants could have used the company \"fraudulently\", and said that should be enough for officials to find how widespread any fraud was. They were arriving in New Zealand ripe for exploitation as they had no money to support themselves, he said. \"I'm concerned that they are perpetrators but also potential victims.\" It was \"extraordinary\" that the minister admitted no work had been done to review past applications. \"Of course it's in the public interest to make sure our visa system has integrity.\" (radionz.co.nz)", "intro": "Hundreds of students from Sri Lanka could be here illegally, while officials do what they can to investigate claims of a major scam involving student visa applications from Sri Lanka.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/9799-sri-lankan-visa-scam-revealed-but-no-review-of-past-applications"},

According to a Health Division spokesman, although this allowance is being accorded to all government doctors at present, there is no transparent mechanism to determine if these doctors are actually engaged in this service and is eligible to receive this allowance.

Dismissing allegations by the GMOA that through the new Inland Revenue Act has created unfavourable repercussions for the government medical officers, the Treasury official said that only doctors earning over Rs. 350,000 per month will be liable to pay a tax of 24% for income above that cap. \u00a0Hence, if a doctor is to earn over Rs. 350,000 per month, then they invariably must engage in private practice. The Treasury official pointed out that doctors who are not engaged in private practice will only be liable to pay a maximum tax of 14% through the new tax law. The government currently provides a vehicle permit to doctors with a tax concession of Rs. 3.6 million. For a doctor who joins the government medical service at 30 and retires at 60 he/she is eligible to receive at least 06 vehicle permits with Rs. 3.6 million tax concession. This official pointed out that it is the country\u2019s general public who eventually has to bear the burden of these concessions. He further pointed out that the GMOA had not shown much interest in the government proposal to uplift the standard and quality of the private medical education, but kept harping on the minimum qualifications only. This official pointed out that there is insufficient facilities at the state medical universities to provide and receive quality medical education for medical students on par with international standards, adding that there is a dire need to uplift the local medical education standards to meet these international standards. He further noted that the Treasury is paying great attention to the proposals put forward by the GMOA and on how best to come up with solutions to these issues. \u00a0", "intro": "The government has taken a decision to increase the On Call doctors allowances (DAT) from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 50,000 and the allowance being paid to Specialist doctors to Rs. 60,000.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/9762-doctors-allowances-to-be-increased"},

{"topic": "Baratha\u2019s bodyguard fired first", "date": "Jul 25, 2018", "full_news": "President Counsel, Anuja Premarathna made submissions today when the appeal by former MP Duminda Silva requesting the court to acquit him was taken up for hearing before the bench of 5 Supreme Court Judges chaired by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep. The President Counsel further stated that Bharatha Lakshman\u2019s bodyguard, Gamini fired gunshots at former MP Duminda Silva while he was turning back to leave the scene and this episode of shooting by Gamini led to every other subsequent incident. President Counsel Anuja Premarathna reiterated today several factors that were agreed upon by all including the Attorney General\u2019s Department. The factors agreed with the Attorney General\u2019s department are: Bharatha Lakshman\u2019s bodyguard, Gamini fired two gunshots to Duminda Silva\u2019s head. Soon after he received gunshots, Duminda Silva was fatally injured and was removed from the scene and rushed to the hospital. President Counsel, Anuja Premarathna stated although all the parties including the Attorney General\u2019s Department admitted that Duminda Silva was first shot. The majority trial at bar judgment had ignored this important fact. President council said it is surprising to note that the majority judgment by Honorable Padmini Ranawaka stated that a case has been filed against Gamini for causing grievous hurt to Former MP Duminda Silva when there is no such case filed at all. He questioned how the honorable judge arrive at such a conclusion, as nothing of this sort was revealed in evidence. The President Counsel further pointed out that the Bharatha Lakshman\u2019s faction started the shooting as Duminda Silva was turning to leave the scene. He said that every incident erupted because Bharatha Lakshman\u2019s bodyguard, Gamini started the shooting. The President Counsel further stated that both factions would have dispersed if Baratha Lakshman's faction hadn\u2019t fired gunshots injuring Duminda Silva. He emphasized that when Duminda Silva Arrived at the scene no one including Duminda Silva would have ever imagined that Gamini will fire at Duminda Silva and as such the origin of the incident was sudden. Under these circumstances, any charges if at all should be directed as personal and individual. Further, it was pointed out that the prosecution had failed to prove who had shot at Baratha faction when they were running away after shooting Duminda Silva. Meanwhile, President Counsel, Anura Meddegoda stated that the investigators have fabricated a story on the recovery of firearms with an intention to falsely implicate Duminda Silva. He pointed out that the accused from whom recovery of such firearms was made had been wrongly arrested at the Airport and, the investigators had forced him to place his signature on blank papers. The President Counsel pointed out that it is questionable how charges against Duminda Silva for using firearms had been filed. In addition, President Counsel Saliya Peries stated that he too agreed with the submissions made previously by his two fellow President Counsels. The oral submissions were concluded today and, Chief Justice Priyasath Dep stated that the written submissions should be filed before August 10th.

This is really a scandal about an MP attempting to stand in the way of international justice for the tens of thousands of civilians who lost their lives at the hands of the Sri Lankan government and the so-called Tamil Tigers. \u201cMr Paisley saw fit to lobby the Prime Minister against a UN investigation into gross human rights violations, including the mass-killing of civilians at the end of the Sri Lankan war, for which no adequate investigation has ever been carried out. Mr Paisley\u2019s intervention \u2013 which the House of Commons has found to be a breach of the rules on paid advocacy - was a moral disgrace, serving the interests of an abusive regime, not its victims. \u201cAmnesty has long held concerns about Sri Lanka\u2019s attempts to whitewash its image and both delay and deny justice for the families of those who were killed or disappeared, including through the use of accommodating parliamentarians. This episode should serve as a reminder that, nine years on from the end of the Sri Lankan civil war, its victims are still waiting for justice.\u201d Mr Paisley\u2019s suspension is the longest issued to an MP in almost 70 years. In March 2014, the MP lobbied against a proposed United Nations resolution to investigate alleged human rights abuses during the Sri Lankan civil war. The UK government ignored his call and voted for the resolution. A UN expert panel estimates that up to 40,000 Sri Lankan civilians were killed in the final, bloody months of the war. Enforced disappearances, extrajudicial executions, torture and other serious human rights violations and abuses were committed with impunity before, during and in the aftermath of the armed conflict between government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) that ended in 2009. Commitments made by Sri Lanka in 2015 \u2013 through its co-sponsorship of UN Human Rights Council resolution 30/1 \u2013 to establish truth, justice and reparation mechanisms and reforms aimed at non-recurrence of these crimes, have not yet been implemented.", "intro": "Amnesty International has issued a statement following the UK parliamentary approval of the 30-day suspension issued to North Antrim MP Ian Paisley over his failure to declare two luxury family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan Government.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/9713-ian-paisley-s-intervention-a-moral-disgrace-ai"},

Following his visit to Sri Lanka in from 10-14 July 2017 at the invitation of the Government, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture had concluded that \u201cthe use of torture and ill-treatment to obtain a confession from detainees under the PTA is routine practice.\u201d The Special Rapporteur was extremely concerned to learn that eighty per cent of those most recently arrested under the PTA in late 2016 complained of torture and physical ill-treatment following their arrest, in cases which were later dealt with under ordinary criminal law.

A cap on interest rates charged by micro-finance companies has been a long-term demand of groups agitating against exploitative loan schemes targeting the country\u2019s poorest people. Activists say predatory loans charging exorbitant interest rates cause borrowers to take loans on top of loans, creating a cycle of debt that has impoverished communities that are already economically vulnerable, especially in the war-devastated regions, leading to suicide and other socio-economic tensions. Enterprise Sri Lanka launched by the Ministry of Finance in June this year plans to grant subsidised loans to the public to encourage entrepreneurship. The lending scheme gives lower-income communities options beyond microfinance loans. The Minister presented cheques to a large number of loan receivers at several banks in both districts and the majority of the recipients were women. Prabajini Kamalraj, an expectant mother in Mullaitivu was obtaining a loan to complete the roof of her house before the arrival of her first child. Invited by Minister Mangala Samaraweera to declare open the Enterprise Sri Lanka Desk at the Bank of Ceylon branch in Mullaitivu, Prabajini seemed pleasantly surprised. A majority of those obtaining the low interest loans hoped to build new homes or complete their partly constructed houses while others such as Pathmanathan Perumal, a peanut farmer, obtained a loan of Rs. 200,000 to buy a drizzling water system for his cultivation. Some also obtained loans to buy fishing gear, others to install solar panels for their homes and businesses. The borrowers acknowledged that the process was simple enough compared to obtaining regular loans from banks. However, some of those receiving the loans said they were already in debt. Commenting on the Enterprise Sri Lanka program, political economist Dr. Ahilan Kadirgamar said it will most likely help to increase production in the North and support the growth of its economy. He said earlier loan disbursement by local banks was low in the North. \u201cThe banks have been reluctant to provide loans due to being in an economically bad situation,\u201d he said.

Noting that the number of three-wheelers in Sri Lanka has increased eight-fold since the year 2000, the minister noted that t he fuel consumption per person has increased from 90 litres to 150 litres during the same time. \"Additionally, the import taxes on a diesel three-wheeler will be increased by Rs. 50,000 to encourage the transition to environmentally friendly alternatives. Furthermore, under the Enterprise Sri Lanka credit schemes, the Ministry of Finance will incorporate a subsidised loan scheme to enable three-wheeler drivers to invest in a multitude of additional services including meters, WIFI, GPS facilities, that would act as value-added services that are already provided to consumers; both domestic and tourists. We are also developing a proposal to encourage entrepreneurship amongst the spouses of three wheeler drivers,\" he said. The full speech of the minister is as follows : With more than 1 million three-wheeler drivers in Sri Lanka, the three-wheeler industry is indeed a major sector of the country. The \u2018Sri Lankan tuk\u2019 has in fact become something of an icon as it is used in myriad aspects. It is an affordable means of transport for small business, providing last mile connectivity for SMEs and entrepreneurs. Three wheelers are a means of affordable private transportation as well, and is increasingly popular in the tourism industry. As such, the government of Sri Lanka has recognised the importance of this sector to the economy and intends to further empower those involved in the industry. One such example is from the 2018 budget, where we conceived the \u2018tourist friendly tuk-tuk\u2019 concept in collaboration with the hospitality industry. This programme provides for existing three-wheeler drivers to register with the SLTDA so that a three-wheeler would not only be a mode of transportation, but the driver to serve as a local tourist-guide as well. This policy was initiated to create a win-win situation for all stakeholders involved and improve the quality of services provided in the tourism industry. I am pleased to announce that the implementation is progressing well and thus far 589 drivers have undergone training. The introduction of electric three-wheelers to this industry is another important new policy. There are several reasons for the shift from the fossil fuel tuk to the electric version, and environmental concerns are chief amongst them. As part of the Paris agreement, Sri Lanka has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10% in the transport sector by 2020. Among the host of recommendations, one way to achieve this reduction is to convert the existing vehicles to \u2018zero-emission\u2019 vehicles, which would cause minimum levels of pollution and carbon footprint. The number of three-wheelers in Sri Lanka has increased eight-fold since the year 2000. The fuel consumption per person has increased from 90 litres to 150 litres during the same time. In 2017, Sri Lanka spent nearly USD 3.5 B to import fossil fuels for the generation of electricity and transportation. This is equivalent to around 4% of GDP. Therefore, Sri Lanka needs a longer term sustainable solution to mitigate the negative environmental consequences that arise as well as a solution to minimise the forex outflows from the country. As a result, the vehicle policy in the 2018 budget too was designed to incentivise to move to a greener fleet of vehicles. The excise tax is structured such that diesel and petrol vehicles are taxed at a higher rate, making hybrids and electric vehicles more attractive. The loan to value ratio for electric and hybrid vehicles is also more favourable to encourage this segment of the market. Additionally, the import taxes on a diesel three-wheeler will be increased by Rs. 50,000 to encourage the transition to environmentally friendly alternatives. Furthermore, under the Enterprise Sri Lanka credit schemes, the Ministry of Finance will incorporate a subsidised loan scheme to enable three-wheeler drivers to invest in a multitude of additional services including meters, WIFI, GPS facilities, that would act as value-added services that are already provided to consumers; both domestic and tourists. We are also developing a proposal to encourage entrepreneurship amongst the spouses of three wheeler drivers. I am indeed encouraged by the electric three-wheeler developed by Japan Sri Lanka Comprehensive Partnership secretariat and T-PLAN. It is considered to have incorporated some of the cutting-edge technology available in this industry. I understand that the first batch of electric three wheelers manufactured in Sri Lanka will be ready by mid-2020, in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. It is very exciting to hear that T-PLAN hopes to export the Sri Lankan made electric vehicles to Japan. This would be the first of many technology transfer projects that are currently being incubated by the Japan Sri Lanka Comprehensive Partnership secretariat. Through such policies and projects, the government of Sri Lanka will not only show continued commitment to the empowerment of the three-wheeler industry, but also to achieving long term economic growth through sustainable development. I\u2019d like to reiterate how encouraged I am by this endeavour and I wish everyone involved all success.", "intro": "The Government yesterday (23) introduced electric three-wheelers in an effort to improve sustainability and lower transportation costs to boost the industry.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/9675-govt-introduces-electric-tuk-tuks-pics"},

Panama is a small town about 14km from Arugam Bay and an 8-hour drive from Colombo. Safari Panama is one of the few tourism operators in the area, having built up a reputation for wildlife safari (at Kumana National Park) and beach camping among tourists who are looking for something more than catching the waves. This, as well as the unique tourism model the town has developed \u2013 almost by accident \u2013 was identified as a potential change-maker by the Australian Government\u2019s Market Development Facility (MDF) programme, which is working to diversify tourism in Sri Lanka. Panama\u2019s fledgling tourism scene is capitalising on something visitors to Sri Lanka are now increasingly craving: \u2018authentic\u2019 Sri Lankan experiences. \u201cWe have many homestays in Panama,\u201d explains Priyantha Pushpakumara, Safari Panama owner and the chief entrepreneur of the area\u2019s tourism scene. \u201cMost of them are run by the women of the household, whose husbands work as day labourers and sometimes fishers. Tourists enjoy staying in these because they love the \u2018homely\u2019 experience, and especially the home-cooked food!\u201d The homestays add local flavour to a naturally appealing destination that is slowly gaining fame. Priyantha acts as tour guide cum travel agent for the Panama tourism scene, encouraging his wildlife and camping tourists to board at the homestays. Supported by MDF, Priyantha has been working to formalise his role, and at the opening ceremony signed agreements with 7 female homestay owners who will be officially promoted by Safari Panama, with standardised rates and a more streamlined service offering. In addition, Safari Panama is creating a network of individual safari jeeps and tuk-tuks to offer safe and reliable transport for tourists interested in visiting the beach or Kumana. Speaking at the event, Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson applauded the project for drawing the community into tourism gains: \u201cFor Panama, this is an excellent way to join Sri Lanka\u2019s growing tourism market, and for women a way to join an industry in which they often face many barriers to entry.\u201d Tourism is notoriously low on female employment numbers, for a number of reasons including social perceptions relating to women working with foreign tourists and difficulties in managing household obligations with non-traditional work hours. Operating a homestay removes the mobility barrier, and having a group of women in the village running similar establishments has increased community buy-in in Panama, and reduced stigma. MDF works in Sri Lanka to diversify the tourism offering. An important aspect of the model is to identify businesses like Priyantha\u2019s which are embedded into the community and have the potential to have a large impact on people who would not otherwise have the chance to connect with, or benefit from, tourism. \n\n \n\n", "intro": "Tourists who visit the Eastern Province often end up limiting their trip to surfing at Arugam Bay or traveling up the coast to scenic Trincomalee.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/9616-the-east-opens-its-doors-to-safari-tourism-pics"},

Making the submission on behalf of the Attorney General\u2019s Department, the Deputy Solicitor General said that Bharatha Lakshaman\u2019s security guard, Gamini fired the shots first and former MP Duminda Silva fell on the ground after he received Gamini\u2019s gunshots in his head. During previous hearings, the president counsels stated that it was proved by some evidence during the High Court trial that former MP Duminda Silva was shot at first and the medical reports have also proved that Duminda Silva received gunshots in his forehead. The president counsels further said that the verdict against former MP Duminda Silva has been given neither on the evidence nor on the facts but based on his personality as a popular political icon. The said that although the verdict is read one hundred thousand times, it is not possible to understand why former MP Duminda Silva has been convicted. Thus, they pointed out that the verdict which convicted former MP Duminda Silva is neither actual nor authentic. They said that the High Court judge has given the verdict based on the opinions submitted by the state counsels but without examining whether the evidence is proven beyond reasonable doubt. The president counsels further pointed out before the Supreme Court that the High Court has ignored the submissions made by the defendant and has conducted the trial merely based on the fictitious incidents and evidence. They said that this case was filed to tarnish the image of former MP Duminda Silva, therefore, he has been denied a justifiable trial similar to that of any other citizen is entitled to in this case. In addition, the president counsels further pointed out before the Supreme Court that the evidence in every incident that was given to make former MP Duminda Silva guilty was contradictory. They said that the verdict has itself stated that such evidence given by the witnesses could not be accepted as 100% correct. They said former MP Duminda Silva has been made guilty of charges which are not included in the indictment and, that is not legal at all. They said despite the omissions and contradictions were pointed out in the High court they were not taken for proper consideration in giving the judgment. They stated that the CID has made false charges against former MP Duminda Silva by fabricating such incidents. The president counsels pointed out before the Supreme Court that charges were made against former MP Duminda Silva on using firearms but they did not produce any evidence to prove them during the trial. In addition, charges were made that former MP Duminda Silva intimidated voters but the Court was of the opinion that such charges have no any truth. Therefore former MP Duminda Silva should be acquitted of the charge that he acted under a common agenda, they noted. The president counsels said that the security guards of former MP Duminda Silva have returned fire under the vested power in them to perform their duty after Bharatha Lakshman\u2019s faction started firing first. They said the investigators have created false incidents to make former MP Duminda Silva somehow a culprit of this incident. They said that such facts including the report of the Government Analyst and other evidence were produced during the High Court trial, former MP Duminda Silva was convicted without taking such concrete evidence into consideration. The further hearing will be held on Friday.

{"topic": "UK MP urged to quit over holidays funded by", "date": "Jul 19, 2018", "full_news": "Ian Paisley had already apologised for what he said was his \u201cunintentional failure\u201d to register the hospitality, which he estimated was worth \u00a350,000. Politicians from across the political divide in Northern Ireland have called on the high-profile MP to stand down. The 30-day suspension recommended by a parliamentary watchdog on Wednesday could force Mr Paisley to face a by-election. Members who are suspended from the Commons for more than 10 days are open to a recall petition. A by-election would be triggered if 10% of the electorate in Mr Paisley\u2019s North Antrim constituency sign that petition. If rubber stamped by Parliament, the suspension will also mean Prime Minister Theresa May will be shorn of one of the 10 DUP MPs propping up her minority government during a period that could see a number of crucial Brexit votes in the House of Commons. Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said Mr Paisley should do the \u201chonourable thing\u201d and quit. \u201cI think the charges made against him and findings against him are very serious,\u201d she said. \u201cI would imagine his constituents in North Antrim, and certainly public opinion across Ireland, would expect that having been sanctioned in the way he\u2019s been sanctioned then he should do the honourable thing and step down.\u201d The SDLP said Mr Paisley\u2019s position was \u201cuntenable\u201d. Party Assembly member Colin McGrath said a 30-day suspension was not enough. \u201cThe SDLP will be seeking a recall petition to dismiss Paisley from Westminster, and should this trigger a by-election in North Antrim, Mr Paisley should not challenge the seat again,\u201d he said. Alliance Assembly member Paula Bradshaw also urged Mr Paisley to consider his position. \u201cMr Paisley has let both himself and his constituents down, calling into question his personal integrity and the ability of voters to trust him,\u201d she said. Leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice party Jim Allister called on Mr Paisley to refund the Sri Lankan government the money it spent on hosting him, accusing the MP of \u201cserious and shameful\u201d breaches of Parliament\u2019s code of conduct. The sanction was outlined by the House of Commons Standards Committee following receipt of the findings of an investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. The committee said Mr Paisley, son of late DUP founder the Rev Ian Paisley, had committed \u201cserious misconduct\u201d and his actions \u201cwere of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute\u201d. The report, which said the cost of the hospitality may have been \u201csignificantly more\u201d than Mr Paisley\u2019s \u00a350,000 estimate, said the Sri Lankan holidays in 2013 included business-class air travel, accommodation at first-class hotels, helicopter trips and visits to tourist attractions for the North Antrim MP and his wider family. The trips also included meeting with Sri Lankan governmental figures. The threshold for registering such hospitality in 2013 was around \u00a3660. In March 2014, Mr Paisley wrote to the then prime minister David Cameron to lobby against a proposed United Nations resolution setting up an international investigation into alleged human rights abuses in Sri Lanka. The committee noted that in his letter, the MP did not declare the financial benefits he and his family had received from the Sri Lankan government during the previous 12 months. Amnesty International Northern Ireland director Patrick Corrigan said: \u201cThe real outrage at the heart of this scandal is an MP attempting to have the United Kingdom government oppose a United Nations investigation into the horrific war crimes committed in Sri Lanka.\u201d The watchdog also recommended that Mr Paisley should now register the holidays with the parliamentary authorities. The recommendations will need to be approved by the House of Commons before being confirmed. Mr Paisley is due to address the House on Thursday. The story was first reported by The Daily Telegraph in September 2017, in a report which estimated the cost of the hospitality at \u00a3100,000. A statement issued by Mr Paisley\u2019s lawyer on Thursday said: \u201cMy client has apologised unreservedly at the outset for his unintentional failure to register the hospitality he received. \u201cWhile accepting the decision of the House Standards Committee, he nonetheless continues to take issue with the sensationalised report in the Daily Telegraph. \u201cLegal proceedings are being considered. \u201cNo further comment will be made until Mr Paisley has addressed the House on Thursday.\u201d A DUP spokesman said: \u201cThe party has noted the House of Commons Standards Committee\u2019s report on Ian Paisley MP.

Addressing the event, Minister of Finance and Media - Mangala Samaraweera said that Early Childhood Development (ECD) is of great importance to Sri Lanka as it has the potential to improve school learning outcomes, which can have long lasting effects on the well-being of the population. \u201cAt the heart of empowerment is education. It is education at all levels that endows people with the necessary skills to actively participate in the economy\u201d, Samaraweera added. The Minister pointed out that as Sri Lanka positions itself as a highly competitive knowledge-based economy, robust cognitive development from an early stage becomes essential. Furthermore, he said that the government will spend 6% of its GDP for education by 2020. \u201cIn 2014, the previous government spent only 1.46% of its GDP for education. Today, we have increased this percentage to 3.5%. Our aspiration is to allocate 6% of the country's GDP for education by 2025\u201d, Samaraweera said. Investing in health, nutrition, education and protection from birth through to age five - known as Early Childhood Development (ECD) - enables all children to reach their full brain capacity, and is one of the most effective and proven drivers of sustainable economic growth. Budget proposals focused on Health and Nutrition, Protection and Early Childhood Education were presented by the Ministries of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Women and Child Affairs and Education, to the Minister of Finance and Mass Media for his consideration in the National Budget for 2019. For Sri Lanka, the cost of not investing in critical interventions that ensure a child's full brain development could be substantial including a generation with poorer health, fewer learning skills and even a reduced earning capacity resulting in a weaker economy with a greater burden on social welfare systems. Speaking at the event, Tim Sutton, the UNICEF Representative for Sri Lanka said the proposals presented today have the power to transform the lives of children, and drive Sri Lanka's economic growth. \"Evidence shows that this investment is one of the most cost effective ways to build this country's human capital, with a return on investment of as much as 13.7 per cent. We urge the Government of Sri Lanka and the Members of Parliament to support this call for national budget investment in early childhood, to ensure that every child in the country reaches their full potential,\" he said.

{"topic": "The service extension of the Army Commander determines the", "date": "Jul 14, 2018", "full_news": "With the service extension granted to\u00a0\u00a0Army Commander Mahesh Senanayake by the President, it has affected the fate of many Generals, reported the \u2018Mawbima\u2019 newspaper.\u00a0\u00a0 He was appointed as the 20th\u00a0Army Commander on June 27, 2017 after a cold war within the army, as he is considered an exceptionally capable military officer. The tussle for the post of Commander at the time was between Major General Mahesh Senanayake, Boniface Perera and Sudantha Ranasinghe. However, Mahesh Senanayake who is a silent and unassuming, composed officer was selected to the post, based on his long term experience as an accomplished officer. The other two were officers who had joined the army having followed short term courses. President Maithripala Sirisena took the decision to appoint Mahesh Senanayake as the Army Commander based on his talents, discipline and proves as a soldier, casting aside all traditions followed by the army. He was thus appointed to the post in 2017. Mahesh Senanayake assumes duties as the Army Commander just 1 \u00bd months prior to reaching his retirement age of 55. He reached 55 years on August 19 last year and was granted a service extension f one year. As the current Army Commander\u2019s term was scheduled to end on August 18, this year, a silent cold war was launched between the other generals vying for the post. The eligible senior officers as usual, began running behind religious leaders and politicians, with the hope of securing their position as the next commander in line. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka made a concerted attempt to have Major General Piyal Wickramaratne appointed as the next Commander as he is a member of his regiment, the Sinha Regiment. Maj. Gen. Piyal Wickramaratne had even applied for a service extension having completed his retirement age of 55. The general practice was that the Chief of Staff of the Army who is the second in command be appointed to the post of Commander. Major General Piyal Wickramaratne, is currently the\u00a0\u00a0Commandant, Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force (SLAVF) and reaches his retirement age of 55 on September 02, 2018. . Previously, Major General G.A. Chandrasiri was granted an extension during the tenure of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka based on the grounds that he was required in Jaffna to maintain security. However, Major General Sumedha Perera and Maj. Gen.\u00a0\u00a0Jagath Dias who were also clever soldiers had to retire after reaching 55 as the present government did not extend their terms. Although they both served as the second in command of the army, as the Chief of staff, they had to retire with the post of Commander within their grasp, as they were not accorded extensions. With the current Commander\u2019s term scheduled to end in August, a cold war was launched by the other candidates, knowing well that if the current commander is granted an extension, their hopes would be dashed.\u00a0 The President had taken the decision to grant service extensions to both the Army Commander and the Air Force Commander, due to their direct leadership in carrying out the affairs of the army and air force, The President had evaluated the exceptional and exemplary\u00a0\u00a0service rendered by them and had decided during the past New Year season to extend their terms. The extension was not made known until the Air Force Commander\u2019s term completion and no one knew about the Army Commander\u2019s extension too until just this week. Previously, the former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka was granted a three year extension by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa after he had completed 55 years.\u00a0\u00a0 Even the previous Army Commander Chrishantha Silva was granted three consecutive service extensions for three years after he reached 55 years, by the current regime. The next in line for this privilege is Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake. Meanwhile, 54 Major Generals are scheduled to reach retirement age by next year. This is a fate they will have to endure, even if the current Commander had retired and another was appointed. This is because all Major Generals who reach the retirement age of 55 years are not granted service extensions. After their retirement, around 4-5 Major Generals would still remain and the Brigadiers awaiting promotions would get the opportunity to be promoted to the rank of Major General. As around 40 Major General are scheduled for retirement, they have launched a campaign through politicians to bring in a proposal to extend their service until the age of 57. Their hope was to enforce the gazette brought in by the previous regime, allowing a Major General to remain in service until 57 years of age. President Sirisena had discussed this proposal at the Security Council meeting. However, while the Air Force and Navy Commanders had agreed to this proposal, it is said that the Army Commander had opposed this proposal. The Army Commander had shown cause for his objection stating that the junior officers who had rendered a great service during the war would be deprived of their promotions in the event this proposal to increase the retirement to 57 years is implemented. During the war, based on the requirement at the time, many who had joined the army having followed the short term course, were granted promotions up to the rank of Major General, which resulted in many infantry officers having to retire from the army having served the maximum service tenure in the same posts. They were thus, deprived of their promotions. According to the seniority list, a large number of officers are scheduled to retire as they were those who had joined the army in 1984 and 1985. In those years the highest number of cadets were recruited. Under those recruitments officers born in 1963, 1964 should be prepared to retire having completed 55 years. The current Chief of Staff Major General Dampath Fernando is the only infantry officer who joined under intake 18. He will reach the retirement age of 55 on October 02 and is scheduled to retire. Maj. Gen. Piyal Wickramaratne who joined under intake 18 is scheduled to retire on September 02. Wijayabahu Regiment officer Maj. Gen. Ajith Kariyakarawana is scheduled to retire on April 21, 2019. Another 19 Major Generals who joined under intake 19 will complete 55 years by next year and would have to retire. Maj. Gen. R.M. Dias is also scheduled to retire on April 25, 2019.

Text of the speech: 1. I am grateful to the Government of Singapore and the sponsoring agencies, the Centre for Livable Cities, the National Water Agency, the Ministry of Environment, and the National Environmental Agency, for inviting our delegation to the 6th World Cities Summit, CleanEnviro Summit and International Water Week. 2. Attending this Conference brings to mind the Singapore of 1965, which I have seen through photographs and newsreels. It was just another Asian city: impressive colonial buildings stood alongside squalid urban slums filled by the poor and unemployed. 50 years later, Singapore offers the best quality of life of all Asian cities, according to Mercer\u2019s 2018 Quality of Life Survey. Of course, Singapore did not reach this status autonomously: the late Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew envisioned and executed its transformation into a smart, secure and livable city \u2013 a standard of distinction being that a woman can walk alone, safely, without being violated anytime of day or night. As Asia\u2019s best example of a well-managed metropolitan environment, Singapore shows us a path to successfully build large yet livable cities given this is a tangible challenge of our times. Providing leadership to this bi-annual Conference is testimony to your achievements. 3. I use the term \u201cAnthropocene\u201d to describe the times we live in because it is an era indelibly shaped by human activity. One such incredibly influential activity has been our large-scale migration from the countryside to the city; thus the \u201cAnthropocene\u201d is fundamentally marked by urbanization. Data from the World Bank shows that in 2017, 54.7% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 that is 4.1 billion people \u2013 lived in urban areas. 4. This has happened because around the world, urbanization has been a transformative trend that has propelled economic growth. By bringing people and enterprises together, large cities have become centres of industrialisation and modernisation. They have reaped the benefits of economies of agglomeration. When firms and workers cluster together there is improved productivity and job creation. Mega-cities have gone one step further: they have become highly productive centres which connect workers and businesses with global markets. Cities, therefore, have become hubs of wealth creation, attracting waves of people with opportunities for advancement not available in their villages. 5. Of course, the allure of urban life also resulted in the unexpectedly rapid, and therefore unplanned, expansion of cities in South and South East Asia. This, in turn, created challenges of congestion: immense population pressures on infrastructure, basic services, land, housing, and the environment. Apart from constraining the benefits of agglomeration, these pressures also reduce the quality of life of a city\u2019s residents. It leaves them unable to access sanitation, sewage, transport, and decent housing. It condemns them to breathing polluted air and to drinking contaminated water. It leaves their homes and lives vulnerable to the ravages of climate change and natural disasters. And compels them to create subcultures in a city\u2019s underbelly \u2013 as ghettos, gangs, drug traffickers, transient communities etc.. 6. These opportunities and challenges are magnified in Asia multi-city agglomerations. The Beijing- Tianjin- Qinhuangdao corridor has a population of over 100 million. I can see a future where a sprawl of mega urban centres stretches from Beijing to Bangkok to Jakarta to Mumbai. Although cities across Asia are growing apace, only three (Singapore, Tokyo, and Kobe) are in the top 50 of the Mercer Quality of Life index. Colombo was the highest ranked South Asian city, but still only stood at 137 out of 231 cities. At least 15 Asian cities are in the bottom 50 of this ranking. Our challenge, as leaders, is to make these Asian cities livable for the present and the future. The sustainable development of our globe depends on whether we succeed or fail. 7. Asian urban centers are taking the lead in integrating their national economies with global value and supply chains. Metropolitan regions with mega infrastructure is the key to transnational connectivity that enables global economic integration. 8. Sri Lanka\u2019s long-term objective envisages exploiting our strategic location in the Indian Ocean to ensure our economic development in a region which will be pivotal for global economic growth. By 2050 the population in the littoral states of Bay of Bengal \u2013 that is in the East Indian Ocean alone will be 2.9 Billion. 9. The key thrust of the Sri Lanka initiative will be the Western Megapolis and the two connecting corridor which will cover 9 million people. The mega infrastructure includes the development of the ports of Colombo and Hambantota in the South. The new landfill adjacent to the Colombo Port is planned as an offshore Financial Centre. Four Special Economic Zones will provide the infrastructure for industry. 10. We envision the Western Province of Sri Lanka, which includes Colombo and the capital Sri Jayewardenepura as a Megapolis of interconnected metropolitan areas. This would include a light railway system with elevated railways, elevated highways, a multi-modal transport hub, the development of old waterways, and 3 LNG plants. It will encompass a Logistics City, a Forest City, and an Aero City. We will aim for maximum livability by implementing sewerage and solid waste projects, an Eco Zone, and Riverine Buffer Zone Development. Plans for the megapolis were prepared by Surbana Jurong and the Ministry of Megapolis are in the initial stages of implementation. 10. We will also develop two Urban Corridors; one along the 134 km-long Central Expressway leading to Kandy, and the other along the 241 km-long Southern Highway via Galle, leading to the newly built Hambantota port and Mattala airport. The Southern corridor will include 3 large eco friendly Tourist Resorts of over 500 acres each in addition to a fully restored Galle Heritage Fort. Surbana Jurong is also planning the development of Hambantota. 11. Cities and mega-cities are characterized by wealth creation led by private investment, but this economic process often excludes the interests and viewpoints of marginalized groups such as women, the elderly, children, youth, the disabled and the poor. Therefore to ensure inclusiveness, we have designed our housing policies based on three prongs: redevelopment, relocation, and consolidation. The first prong refers to converting potentially valuable under-used urban land assets into better housing, commercial and service spaces, with community involvement in planning. The second prong is about relocating communities living on hazard-prone land or lands required for essential infrastructure development. The final prong is to legally and socially recognise settlements in Colombo that have been upgraded with secure tenure, services and habitable housing, but are still stigmatized as \"under-served settlements\u201d. 12. We must recognise that our cities cannot stand in isolation: they depend on their hinterland for the provision of the ecosystem services. In Sri Lanka water has become the most critical of these eco-system services. The challenge for the ancient Kingdoms was to manage the vast volumes of water made available by the Monsoons. The rainwater was conserved in artificial ponds and man-made reservoirs for drinking and irrigation, which remain serviceable to this day. In recent years, possibly due to global climate change, while Sri Lanka\u2019s annual precipitation is falling, the frequency of extreme events is increasing. This is further aggravated by the rising population and industrialization of the southwest. The result has been disastrous. Lives, livelihoods, and property have been lost with disturbing regularity through floods and landslides. Water today is a foe. In fact, the 2004 tsunami made the sea our enemy as well. These are all perceptions based on some very valid fears, so how can we overcome them? 13. With respect to water management, Singapore is truly leading the field. Singapore has tried to maximize aquifer retention within its own territory from its first national development plan, but wisely also struck an agreement with neighbouring Johor State in southern Malaysia for water supply. Singapore is also a benchmark in desalination and potable quality recycling of wastewater. This enlightened and frugal attitude is epitomized by *NEWater*, the reclaimed water produced by Singapore\u2019s Public Utilities Board. We can all learn a great deal from Singapore in their wise management of this critical input for livability and development. 14. Thus, the task of building livable and sustainable cities require integrating with global supply chains, social inclusivity, and access to new and old ecosystem services. There are already examples we can learn from. Let me use the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City as an example. Here it assimilated Singaporean and Chinese industry \u2013 thereby it integrates with global supply chains. It subsidises public housing and tries to eliminate barriers for the elderly and the disabled thereby it seeks to be social inclusive. Finally, it invests in integrated wastewater treatment, and non-traditional water sources like desalination thereby it pushes sustainable ecosystem services. Global leaders must take note of the successes and failures of cities such as this. 15. For Sri Lanka or any other country to deal with these challenges, we need to politically and financially revitalize and empower local governments. The biggest issue in the management of mega-cities is that they involve many levels of Government and Local Authorities. Political power in many of our countries were distributed between the Central Government, the Provinces and the Local Authorities in the last century when concepts such as mega-cities and global connectivity had not even been thought of. Given that we will now have to exercise these powers for completely different objectives in a completely different environment, it is inevitable then that we must reconsider the structure of our local governments. 16. As we continue to face these traditional challenges, we must also be aware of the new developments in urbanization, which will characterize the Anthropocene in the 21st Century. One characteristic of high-density living is the opportunity for a wide variety of people-to-people interactions. However, in recent times, human communication has been completely overshadowed by a new phenomenon. Driven by sophistication in electronic sensors for information capture, new generation high-speed internet for rapid information transmission or receipt, and artificial intelligence for making judgments based on the analysis of massive volumes of data, \u201cthings\u201d are now communicating, both with each other and with humans. Around 35 billion \u201cthings\u201d are connected to the Internet today. Cisco Systems estimates that this will rise to 50 billion by 2020, far exceeding the number of humans connected to the internet, estimated at around 4 billion persons using 25 billion apps. 17. This can have an immense impact on the way we live in and govern cities. Consider something seemingly simple, like \u201csmart\u201d streetlights. A 2015 study by the Northeast Group estimated that cities around the world would invest $64 billion in LED and \u201csmart\u201d streetlights by 2025, along with sensors, communications, and analytics software that would make their street lighting infrastructure \u201csmarter\u201d. I will conclude my speech with a question for this conference: How can this phenomenon of hyper-connectivity based on artificial intelligence and the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d be mobilized to maximize human safety and well-being to develop smart, secure livable and sustainable cities?", "intro": "Prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe says local governments needs to be politically and financially revitalized and empowered to deal with the challenges in managing mega-cities.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/9460-local-govts-need-to-be-revitalized-and-empowered-pm"},

He was speaking at a conference for the heads of state owned enterprises (SOEs) at the Hilton Colombo today (05). Hon. State Minister of Finance, Hon. Deputy Minister, Secretary/Ministry of Finance and Media, His Excellency Bryce Hutchesson, High Commissioner of Australia, Ladies and gentlemen, \u00b7 Let me at the outset thank the Department of Public Enterprises for organizing this timely conference for the Heads of State Owned Enterprises (SOE\u2019s) to equip them with the operational aspects on certain financial and administrative instruments. \u00b7 Many of you present here are managing vital economic activities in Sri Lanka such as public transport, public utilities and services. Today I was told there are heads of 55 important SOEs present here from strategically important public ventures. I need to emphasize that your conduct of business plays an essential role in the daily life of our fellow citizens, as well as the productive performance of our national economy. \u00b7 Last year, in the Vision 2025 document, we outlined our government\u2019s policy on the management of public enterprises that proposes to eliminate unproductive expenditure. In V 2025, we made a pledge to restructure SOEs to enable them to operate as commercially viable ventures with accountability. \u00b7 During 2017, your 55 public ventures alone have recorded a total turnover of nearly Rs. 1800 billion which was almost 13.22 percent of the GDP. Out of the 55 SOBs 39 recorded a net profit amounted to Rs. 136 billion while 16 made net losses amounted to Rs. 87 billion in 2017. The total asset base of SOBs grew by 13.6 percent in 2017 over 2016 and it accounted for almost 56.8 percent of the GDP. However, despite their strategic importance, SOEs have not achieved full potential, which is reflected by its low Return Over Assets (ROA) ratio at 0.64 percent. The reasons for such underperformance ranges from lack of good governance practices, including lack of a clear accountability mechanism, policy and legal framework, to a weak supervisory role. I encourage you to address those difficult, but serious issues at your deliberations today. \u00b7 Moreover, in recent years the performance of some SOEs has been a source of concern for the fiscal balance. In 2017, total government revenue declined from 14.2 percent to 13.8 percent, influenced by a drop of revenue from SOEs reaching a 50 percent decline in dividends and levies as compared to 2016. In 2017, four of the main loss making SOEs i.e. Ceylon Electricity Board, Sri Lankan Airlines, Sathosa and Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board combined in losses amounting to Rs. 84 billion. I may say this as a dismal performance that creates public outcry over the mismanagement of our national resources. Ladies and gentlemen, \u00b7 Given the importance of the SOE\u2019s, the government\u2019s strategy is to encourage and facilitate you to be self-sufficient through improved corporate practices, management reforms, innovative financing, strong and prudent financial management, exposure to competitiveness and international best-practices and effective human resource management, while enhancing public accountability. It is pertinent that 2018 Budget allocated funds to operationalize the National Agency for Public Private Partnership (NAPPP), which will be the single facilitation point for all stakeholders in designing and implementing PPPs. You must now make efforts to closely work with the NAPPP in compliance with our PPP initiatives to gain the strength of the private sector to remain viable business operations. \u00b7 The Department of Public Enterprises (PED) has adopted a new approach with the introduction of the Statements of Corporate Intents (SCIs) to support your entities. The SCI is a statement that contains key performance indicators targeting the core activities of the entity which will be reflected in improved financial and non-financial performance. During 2017, five key SOEs became party to the SCI, having signed tripartite agreements. I encourage all of you to follow suit without any delay. \u00b7 We cannot pass on the cost of inefficiency on to the consumer or the general public and therefore it is essential that SOEs eliminate management inefficiencies prior to the implementation of fully cost reflective pricing. As the key players in our national ventures, you may have to relook at your operations seriously to achieve reasonable management improvements in the interest of our fellow citizens. Ladies and gentlemen, \u00b7 It needs to be noted that the role of the Treasury in overseeing the performance of these SOEs is mostly linked to the incorporation of the entity itself. As such, when monitoring the SOEs that are incorporated under the Companies Act, the Treasury\u2019s supervisory role is governed primarily by the responsibilities of that of a shareholder towards an entity as governed by the Articles of Association. With regard to those entities incorporated or established under an Act of Parliament, the Treasury will enact the provisions of the Finance Act no 38 of 1971. In both instances the applicability of the guidelines issued is dependent upon mainly the complexity of the operations, the market conditions and the competencies required ensuring smooth operations. \u00b7 Therefore, when taking decisions the Boards of Management or Directors and the Management must ensure that while being governed by the guidelines and the circulars issued by the Treasury and other applicable entities, the decisions must fundamentally be within a proper legal and regulatory framework. The objectives of the entity should be achieved effectively and efficiently having utilized the available resources. It is important that the Boards and the senior management exhibit due diligence given that the resources under their custody are non-other than public property. \u00b7 It is noted that you are vested with a responsibility to ensure that the entities operate as commercially viable having exercised best business practices. This demands the appointment of personnel who are properly qualified and have the capacity to guide your entities to achieve their objectives. In this context the Treasury envisages conducting awareness programmes for the members of Boards and the senior management on the best practices that must be adopted in guiding the operations of these entities. \u00b7 I expect to see a marked improvement in your performance in the ensuing year to bring our economy to greater heights. Thank you. \n\n \n\n", "intro": "Minister of Finance and Media Mangala Samaraweera advises the heads of state owned enterprises, as key players in national ventures, to relook at their operations seriously to achieve reasonable management improvements in the interest of fellow citizens.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/9407-mangala-tells-soes-to-relook-at-their-operations-seriously"},

The article also alleged China got Sri Lanka in a debt trap and secured the Hambantota port through it. Speaking in parliament yesterday, PM Wickremesinghe only said an investigation would be conducted into the campaign money charge, and did not refer to the other allegation. In his speech to the House today, he said the Rajapaksa regime built the port on a 1,320 million US dollar credit from China, but the government nor the Ports Authority were capable of bringing in any ships to the port. Therefore, the government had no money to pay back the loan, he said. Since 2011, its losses amounted to Rs. 47 billion, and there were only two options open \u2013 declare the loan agreement to be illegal and act accordingly, or to negotiate with the Chinese government. The latter was chosen and at the discussions, it was decided to handover the port\u2019s operations to a state-private partnership company in order to make the port profitable, he said. For that, the Chinese government did not pressurize Sri Lanka, he said. What China asked was only to call for bids first from Chinese companies, and that was done. The most profitable one was the China Merchant Port proposal for a 1,080 million USD investment. This does not amount to a selling of the port, only the port operations are being done by a state-private partnership, said the PM.

He also said the Government would be willing to increase the threshold if the private sector required additional funding. \u201cWe want to help the large private sector. We want to start a Development Finance Corporation and the Finance Ministry is preparing the necessary Cabinet papers with the Central Bank and two State banks as stakeholders. But even before this corporation is formed we are going to release Rs. 10 billion to go through the stakeholders so they can utilise it this year itself. Let\u2019s see how many will use that development finance. If you utilise it, what can we do? We will come up with more. Are you ready? Are you ready to go out?\u201d The Prime Minister quipped that this was one way for the Government to return tax money collected from the private sector. However, striking a sombre note, Wickremesinghe emphasised on the crucial role the private sector must play if Sri Lanka is to expand economic growth in the short to medium term. \u201cWe want growth. As a Government we realise the main role lies with the private sector so we need to change the thinking. Take those opportunities. It is not just you who needs to change your attitude but also the Government. You can\u2019t have a bureaucracy with lots of red tape because time is money. This is why we are looking at the Ease of Doing Business rankings and I have some more radical solutions. We are doing a lot of work in this area, to remove legislation but this will take some time.\u201d Wickremesinghe called for a broadened dialogue between the private sector and the Government urging the private sector to communicate clearly and effectively with the Government on genuine issues that would impact the national interests of Sri Lanka. \u201cGrowth is not only business, it\u2019s also politics. So let\u2019s all work together.\u201d The Prime Minister also spoke extensively of the opportunities that exist in South and Southeast Asia that local companies to tap into to create opportunities and dominate niche markets, which Sri Lankan businesses already have a track record for doing. \u201cWe live in the Southeast Asian region, which is going to be a growing market for the next few decades. Just as much as we have all the opportunity to go to the European market with GSP+ we need more products doing into these markets. Not merely apparel and rubber tires and fish. It means a mindset wiling to face competition. The small and medium enterprises as much as the big companies have a role to play and our job is to help.\u201d \u2018Enterprise Sri Lanka\u2019 is the first step in this direction where 15 lines of credit have been introduced so that entrepreneurs, SMEs and large businesses can all have access to finance, Wickremesinghe noted. He also invited private banks to join the program and support SMEs and pointed out that other developed or developing countries rely on SMEs to create jobs and improve living standards. \u201cMy question is, are you confident enough to take the challenge? It is all about access to markets. You can\u2019t grow fast in a market of 22 million people. If we are to grow you must access the larger markets, your neighbours and global markets, which means we have to become very competitive. The more competitive we are the better chance we have at succeeding.\u201d Wickremesinghe was confident local businesses had the competitiveness to succeed but he strenuously advocated for liberalisation, pointing out a closed economy would not deliver the growth Sri Lanka needs to counter its debt dynamics. He humorously alluded to King Parakramabahu the Great who promoted trade between Sri Lanka and the rest of the world during his rule. \u201cIt is fortunate he lived 800 years ago. Today he would have been accosted by businesses and various chambers saying, \u2018Why are you opening up?\u2019 \u2018Why are you asking us to go abroad?\u2019 He was a lucky man,\u201d the Prime Minister said to laughter from the audience. \u201cCan you expand with protectionism? Or do we expand by going out and becoming better?\u201d he continued in a sombre tone. \u201cIn 1977 we got two tyres for our car each year. We didn\u2019t have the confidence just as we opened up, but now we do.

{"topic": "SriLankan airlines duty free contract awarded sans a tender", "date": "Jun 26, 2018", "full_news": "Rashmore Ferdinands, the In-Flight Services Manager as SriLankan Airlines said in 2011 when tenders were called to supply perfumes and cosmetics for duty-free sales, several bidders had come forward and they included Phoenix Rising Ventures (PRV), International Sales Group and King Power Limited. International Sales Group, however, had highlighted none of their partners or affiliated companies were permitted to bid for this particular tenders using its name or brand. Surprisingly, Phoenix Rising Ventures had submitted a tender stating it had been included in the business for 20 years through International Sales Group and it\u2019s affiliated companies. Another surprising factor was that the letters submitted by PRV from suppliers authorizing PRV to sell their good were identically worded and the only difference was the signature and name of the supplier. All letters stated, PRV was the winner of the SriLankan Airlines contract and they are interested in supplying their goods but the letter of intent is not a contract. It appears Phoenix Rising Ventures had informed the suppliers they had won the tender even before the tender was opened. As the Senior Tender Board had recommended to award the tender to PRV an offer letter was sent to them requesting them to accept, sign and return the document. A factor that came to light at the commission was SriLankan Airlines had made their initial purchase order of the duty-free goods before even signing an agreement. This particular contract was only for a period of six months. One month later rather than reverting on the offer, PRV had sent a proposal addressed to the Chairman of SriLankan Airlines Nishantha Wickremesinghe and CEO Kalila Chandrasena. PRV had proposed to move away from only supplying fragrances and cosmetics and wanted SriLankan Airlines to outsource the entire duty-free program to them for a period of seven years. The proposal, though addressed by PRV, says the process will be taken care of Phoenix Duty-Free Services based in Sri Lanka and was signed by Dilan Weerasinghe as the CEO. PRV had given the proposal directly to the Chairman and CEO of SriLankan Airlines and they had, in turn, handed it to the Board of Directors for Approval. It had been simply approved by the board deviating from the usual norm of following a tender procedure. Another surprising factor was that at the same time King Power Limited, which is chaired by Rakitha Jayawardena had also submitted an alternative proposal similar to what was submitted by PRV. Despite prevailing public outcry, the questioning of witnesses at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry led much to be desired of. The people saw how Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Ministers Kabir Hashim, and Malik Samarawickrama were questioned with Kid Gloves on. To add insult to injury it was reported that a commissioners family member worked for MP Harsha De Silva based at Temple Trees while the inquiry was still going on. Following the conclusion of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, there were allegations of the Commission report making its way to a certain residence before it was released. Subsequently, certain names were withheld for ostensibly secrecy considerations and the President\u2019s Secretary proceeded to archive parts of the Bond Commission Report for reasons best known to him. It is in the light of this tomfoolery and displaced public trust that a Commission was appointed to investigate SriLankan Airlines.

{"topic": "Sri Lanka should allow the rupee to float: IMF", "date": "Jun 21, 2018", "full_news": "\"The central bank should let the exchange rate float,\" Manuela Goretti, the head of an IMF mission to Sri Lanka said. \"The exchange rate should be the first line of defence.\" In May the central bank sold 190 million dollars to defend the currency, selling 220 million dollars and buying 30 million dollars. June data is not yet out. Sri Lanka printed tens of billions of rupees in March and April and put pressure on the rupee, by trying to keep down a spike in the overnight money market rates which may have come from an attempt to manipulate long term bond yields though a so-called a 'buffer'. It then tried to float it with excess liquidity in money markets and the credibility in the peg was lost. However the excess liquidity has since been taken away and money markets are now tighter. The overnight call and repo rates are now around 8.45 to 8.50 percent, which is right at the 8.50 percent ceiling policy rates. Overnight rates cannot go up further without a rate hike, under the liquidity arrangement the central bank currently operates. But central bank, which is also sells debt for the Treasury has kept the three month gilt rate below the overnight money market rate in another distortion that supports speculation against the currency by encouraging exporters to borrow rupees at low rates. This Wednesday, the 3-month rate fell to 8.32 percent from 8.34 percent a week earlier. Analysts say ideally the rupee should be floated after the anomaly in the short term risk free rate is fixed. Long-term central bank watchers say that the central bank also tends to buy dollar from the Treasury in times of currency pressure, providing new rupees, altering the monetary base, loosening the credit system to undermine any float from taking hold. If a float is attempted, such practices should be immediately stopped they say, and the Treasury should sell all dollars in the market for existing rupees. Goretti said the rupee had depreciated less than other emerging market currencies. \"When you look at emerging markets, the rupee has been depreciated less. We do not want to create competitiveness differentials.\" She said Sri Lanka's central bank has followed a more flexible exchange rate in the recent past. In 2017 better managed East Asian currencies and most floating rates (i.e those with a policy rate), appreciated as the dollar weakened and oil rose, while Sri Lanka resisted currency appreciation and collected dollars, raising doubts wheter there was a 'flexible exchange rate policy'. In recent weeks, other emerging market currencies which have relatively credible pegs such as in the Middle East have remained steady amid recent Fed rate hikes, while those with a independent policy rate has weakened. Hong Kong which has a credible peg through an orthodox curency board has also held as usual, though it is defending the currency with unsterilized dollar sales. Sri Lanka which has a discount widnow, cannot engage in unsterilized currency defence after hitting the 8.50 percent ceiling rate. Goretti said a hike in rates would increase real interest rates, raising concerns about growth. Growth was low in the last year amid a drought and forex reserve collections. Until March 2018 the central bank was sterilizing foreign exchange purchases, in a tightly pegged exchange regime, which was in effect tighter than an orthodox currency board, analysts have pointed out. When purchases are sterilized the money supply is smaller than is determined by the balance of payments, at the de facto pegged rate which dollar purchases are made. After making massive liquidity injections in May, expanding the monetary base beyond what is required by the BOP, the central bank then suddenly switched to a floating rate. Analysts have called for the consistent monetary policy, either to have a credible peg, or a fully floating rate. However under an IMF program to collect forex reserves from current transactions, a peg has to be followed.

Xi, who chaired the SCO annual summit Sunday, attributed the SCO's strength to the Shanghai Spirit, which champions mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations and pursuit of common development. Sultan Mehmood Hali, head of Pakistan-China Media Forum and a senior defense and political analyst, echoed Xi's remarks, saying that the Shanghai Spirit is the \"driving force\" and \"guiding force\" for the 17-year-old organization. \"It has gelled the first six countries and now eight countries together to have a common destiny and transcend the differences with each other and develop into a system of cooperation which requires mutual trust, mutual respect and shared values,\" Hali said. At a roundtable meeting, Xi praised the SCO as \"a new model for regional cooperation,\" which was well received by experts. \"Within the framework of the SCO, multiple regional problems can be solved, such as security and strategic stability, as well as economic integration,\" said Boris Volkhonsky, head of the Asia and Pacific Rim Center of the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies. \"Today, with the participation of the leading economies of Eurasia, the SCO has become an integral core,\" said Volkhonsky. The SCO was established in 2001 by China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. With two new members, it now accounts for nearly half of the world's population and over 20 percent of the global economy. At the summit, Xi urged related parties to \"work closely to build an SCO community with a shared future\" and \"move toward a new type of international relations.\" \"We should reject self-centered, short-sighted and closed-door policies,\" Xi said. \"Equality, mutual learning, dialogue and inclusiveness between cultures should be championed.\" Konstantin Garibov, analyst for Russia's Sputnik News Agency, said Xi's speech showed that China is willing to \"help ensure that the Eurasian space becomes a model of a new type of international relations based on a stable world, universal security, common prosperity, openness and inclusiveness.\" Experts also highlighted Xi's emphasis on people-to-people exchanges, saying that it will lead to a win-win situation. MD Nalapat, director of the Department of Geopolitics at Manipal University in India, said China has demonstrated through the SCO that there is a better solution than a military one. \"A better solution is to have a calm solution involving people-to-people contact, involving soft power and involving conciliation,\" he said. \"I think frankly that is the Chinese way, the 'win-win' situation.\" Hali, the Pakistani analyst, believes the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by China can promote such exchanges. It's a platform in which \"you reach out to everyone, you share each other's progress and you benefit from each other,\" he said.

Sri Lanka's economic risk trend has been revised to stable from negative. \"Aggressive growth in the past has led to rising economic imbalances, but we do not expect an escalation,\" S&P Global Ratings said in a statement. Sri Lanka's banking non-performing loans could deteriorate as fallout of aggressive growth of the last few years followed by drought in 2016 and floods in 2017,\" it said. However, the rise in non-performing loans is not expected to be sharp and industry risks will be stable as Sri Lanka's growth prospects are seen improving despite a recent weakening of banks' funding profile. The banking regulator Central Bank's role is seen improving although weaker than peers. Excerpts of Standard and Poor's statement are as follows: \"We classify the banking sector of Sri Lanka in group '8' under our Banking Industry Country Risk Assessment (BICRA). \"Our bank criteria use our BICRA economic risk and industry risk scores to determine a bank's anchor, the starting point in assigning an issuer credit rating. The anchor for banks operating only in Sri Lanka is 'bb-'. \"In our view, the Sri Lankan banking sector's resilience is weak and is affected by the country's low income levels. Credit risk is high, in our opinion, given relaxed lending and underwriting standards as well as evolving risk management practices. \"We have revised Sri Lanka's economic risk trend to stable from negative. We believe that aggressive growth in the past has led to a rise in economic imbalances, but we do not expect further escalation in economic imbalances. While we expect loan growth to remain higher than nominal GDP growth, the gap has narrowed, reducing risks of a further build-up of economic imbalances. Moreover, the sovereign external position continues to stabilize. \"Sri Lankan banks' funding profiles benefit from a good level of stable core customer deposits. In addition, we believe the large number of banks relative to the economy's size has not led to any significant instability in the competitive environment. However, the dominance of government-owned banks and directed lending to the agricultural sector somewhat distort the competitive environment, in our view. \"In our opinion, the Sri Lankan central bank's regulation and supervision have strengthened over the years, although they remain weaker than that of international peers. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka is taking several measures that we believe will help strengthen capital positions of banks' and non-banks in the next few years. The measures would benefit the banking system in the longer term by providing good capital buffers to absorb unexpected losses. Nevertheless, most of the banks will have to step up capital (including hybrid) issuances in 2018. \"The banking system's nonperforming loans (NPLs) could continue to deteriorate in 2018. This is a fallout of banks' aggressive growth in the past few years and Sri Lanka's drought in 2016 and flooding in 2017, which disturbed the agriculture sector and agro-based industrial activity. However, the NPL rise is unlikely to be sharp because we continue to expect Sri Lanka's growth prospects to be favorable. \"We assess the trend for industry risk as stable.

We believe that larger banks with strong franchises will continue to dominate the sector\".

{"topic": "100 Women: The modern face of the 'DIY abortion'", "date": "Jun 07, 2018", "full_news": "By buying pills online and sharing medical advice through WhatsApp groups, women are increasingly turning to technology to sidestep legal barriers to abortion. This is the modern face of the so-called \"DIY abortion\". Countries with the strictest laws, where abortion is allowed only to save a woman's life or banned altogether, have over 10 times higher search interest in abortion pill Misoprostol compared to countries with no restrictions, BBC analysis shows. There are two main methods of inducing abortion; surgical and medical. A medical abortion typically involves taking a combination of pills, Misoprostol and Mifeprostone, to induce a miscarriage. Misoprostol can also go by brand names like Cytotec. While women in countries such as the UK will be prescribed this combination by a doctor, women searching for and purchasing the pills online in countries where access to abortion is restricted are often breaking the law, risking severe punishments. Ghana and Nigeria are the two countries with the highest search interest in Misoprostol, according to the Google data. Ghana only allows abortions in cases of rape, incest, foetal impairment or to preserve a woman's mental health. Nigeria is stricter still: abortion is only allowed in situations where a woman's life is in danger. Of the 25 countries with highest search interest in Misoprostol, 11 are in Africa and 14 in Latin America. All but two - Zambia and Mozambique - either ban abortions altogether or allow them only to save a woman's life or health. The BBC recently reported on a WhatsApp group, operating in Brazil, helping women get hold of the pills and offering them advice during the procedure. Juliana (not her real name) was one of the women who sought the WhatsApp group's help. \"I did the procedure alone at my house and reported the time I was going to start to the WhatsApp group,\" says the 28-year-old. \"What I thought was really nice, is how the other women in the group help each other, sharing information, and discussing doubts and fears. This strengthened me, in a way. \"It's always good to know that you're not alone. The group was very important to me, for me to feel safe.\" Analysing Google data doesn't just show the countries where search interest is highest. It can also show how often exact phrases are searched about a topic. \"Abortion pills\" is a top search phrase on abortion in all the countries analysed by the BBC. \"How to abort\" is the most commonly asked question in more than two-thirds of countries. \"How to use Misoprostol\", \"Misoprostol price\", \"buy Misoprostol\" and \"Misoprostol dosage\" feature among the most common searches around abortion. Alongside abortion pills, women are also turning to their search engines to source alternative methods to self-induce abortions. Herbs like parsley, cinnamon, vitamin C, aspirin and abortion teas (herbal concoctions) all came up as top searched methods. In half of the countries we looked at \"home remedies for abortion\" was a top search related to abortion. One study, which looked at the use of abortion teas in sub-Saharan Africa, found that while some plants did affect the uterus, there were many drawbacks to this traditional method. Along with a lack of data around safety, the study suggested it was hard for practitioners to control dosage and side-effects. None of the \"home remedies\" listed above are considered safe abortion methods by the World Health Organisation. Worldwide, about 25 million unsafe abortions take place each year, according to the World Health Organisation, accounting for 45% of all abortions. These 25 million unsafe abortions are categorised even further. Although Misoprostol is normally considered a safe method of abortion when administered by a medical professional, when it is used by an untrained person it poses risks. When it is administered by an untrained person, the World Health Organisation classes it as \"less safe\" and says this accounts for almost one-third (31%) of the total number of abortions, both safe and unsafe. \"Even when the quality of the drugs is perfect and you follow the protocol to the letter, there is still a failure rate,\" says Dhammika Perera, the global medical director at Marie Stopes International. When a woman buys the pills online, or is provided them by an untrained person, it increases the chances of a failed abortion, he says. These women are also less likely to go for post-abortion care if something goes wrong. \"Stigma, cost, geographical access can all make women hesitate and that puts them at risk,\" Mr Perera says. \"It's slow progress, but that there is progress, is unquestionable. \"Globally some backward steps have been taken, in the US for example, but I remain hopeful.\" About 14% of all abortions were \"least safe\", which means they were provided by untrained persons using dangerous methods, such as the introduction of foreign objects and use of herbal concoctions. Complications such as infection and incomplete abortion can arise from these methods. When an abortion is incomplete, medical professionals may either advise further medication, or a surgical option, depending on the situation. At least 22,800 women die each year from complications of unsafe abortion, the Guttmacher Institute reports.

Wijewardena, speaking to BBC Sinhala Service, predicted that the Rupee could depreciate to between Rs. 160 and Rs. 165 by the end of this year. Now, That situation is likely sooner. Explaining the reasons, Dr. Wijewardena said the country thus had to pay for the dissimilar economic policies. It is important the government, having two key affiliates, follows a single economic policy. The UNP is having a V 2025, while the National Economic Council headed by the president has launched a different economic policy, he noted. However, nobody knows if the two policies match each other or not, he said. The ex-deputy governor went onto say that the structural weaknesses in the economy were resulting in the continuous depreciation of the Rupee. From 2008 onward, instead of focusing on the exports sector, policies were formulated to build an indigenous economy, he said. Exports would have increased in dollars terms, but taken as a ratio of the GDP, it declined from 22 per cent to around 12 pc by 2014-15. The export income (11 billion USD) is now on the decline, while import expenditure has gone up steeply to around 20 billion USD. This year, the trade deficit could be estimated at around 10 billion USD, said Dr. Wijewardena. That gap has to be bridged mainly from foreign remittances by expatriate workers, but that income fluctuates, he noted. It would be dangerous for the Central Bank to release its reserves, comprising mainly of foreign borrowings, in order to meet that requirement, he warned. Therefore, it should get involved in the market very carefully and wisely, making the Rupee to stabilize. But, that mediation did not happen last week, and the Rupee depreciated, he said. The remedial measures he recommends are a change in economic policies for quick results, identifying the export segments that needs to be improved in the next 18 months and identifying the services segments that needs to be improved in the next 24 months.", "intro": "The Sri Lankan Rupee yesterday (07) had its worst ever depreciation against the US dollar, falling to Rs. 160 per dollar.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/8941-depreciation-of-the-rupee-due-to-dissimilar-economic-policies"},
{"topic": "90pc of Sri Lankan women face sexual harassment on", "date": "Jun 08, 2018", "full_news": "The findings, released last week, offer a stark view into women\u2019s vulnerability to violence and discrimination, issues that are poorly understood \u2013 both in Sri Lanka and globally \u2013 because of underreporting and lack of data. Despite the absence of formal data, these issues are all too familiar to women and girls, the survey confirms. \u201cI have witnessed, on multiple occasions, male passengers inappropriately touching and leaning on small girls,\u201d said Varuni Manel*, a 23-year-old study participant. \u201cBus conductors also unnecessarily touch small children when getting on to the bus.\u201d The study also shines a light on the far-reaching effects this harassment has on the lives of women and girls, from their educations and livelihoods to their place of residence and personal relationships. Humiliated and afraid Initiated in 2015, the study included 2,500 individuals between the ages of 15 and 35. Information was gathered through interviews, questionnaires and focus groups. Every administrative district in all of Sri Lanka\u2019s nine provinces was represented. Women reported experiencing a wide range of mistreatment on public transport, including leering, verbal abuse and unwelcome advances, but the majority of harassment was physical. Seventy-four per cent of women and girls reported they had been deliberately touched. Sixty per cent reported their personal space had been invaded, and 52 per cent said the offender\u2019s genitals were rubbed against their bodies. Ninety-seven per cent said the perpetrators were male. Women in the survey described feeling humiliated and afraid. \u201cOnce when I was travelling by bus to go to class, a boy around 15 years old was sitting next to me. He ejaculated on my dress before getting off the bus,\u201d said Rani Kumari*, 18. \u201cThere was nothing I could do. I felt helpless, and I didn\u2019t speak to anyone about it.\u201d Women in Sri Lanka \u2013 especially low-income women \u2013 rely heavily on public transport. Half of female study participants said they use it to go to work, and 28 per cent said it was how they travelled to pursue their educations. There is evidence that harassment and the threat of harassment are limiting women\u2019s mobility, participation in public life and overall well-being. A quarter of survey participants said harassment occurred monthly. About 12 per cent said it occurred daily. In some cases, women reported it was so frequent, and alternative modes of travel so scarce, that they moved residence to escape. Forty-four per cent of women said that harassment on public transport affected their personal lives. Twenty-nine per cent said it had an impact on their school performance, and 37 per cent said it negatively affected their work performance. \u201cAs a nurse I have to work late nights,\u201d Gayanthi Thilini*, 31, said in a focus group. \u201cOn one occasion, after leaving work exhausted, I got onto a bus and noticed a male passenger seated behind me. He was well-dressed and in his mid-40s. He started unnecessarily touching me, and as I objected, he told me that I should travel in a private vehicle.\u201d These abuses \u2013 and the culture of inequality they spring from \u2013 may be contributing to women\u2019s economic marginalization. According to the Census on Population and Housing, labour force participation among women fell from over 39 per cent in 2006 to less than 35 per cent in 2014. The study has started a conversation, not only on safety in public transport but also on the wider issues of violence, women\u2019s rights and gender equality. UNFPA is working with government officials to raise awareness of these matters, and to spread word about a hotline women can call to report abuses. They are also working towards gathering more data on gender discrimination and violence, in order to inform policies that better uphold the rights of women. \"The study is important as it highlights the grave gender discriminations that persist towards women and girls,\u201d said Sharika Cooray, a UNFPA gender analyst in Sri Lanka. It is also \u201ca first step in addressing the data gap at a national level on violence against women,\" she added.

One million from an affiliated company of PTL, had been asked to report to the CID and give a statement, but he had not done so as yet, Senior Additional Solocitor General Yasantha Kodagota told Court.

He noted that with the warrant issued by court, the CID had searched the PTL office and recovered many important documents.   The Attorney appearing on behalf of W.M. Mendis Company, Kolitha Dharmawardena told Court that PTL had provided money to Mendis Co, for the construction of a distillery in Kalkuda and to pay off the debt of Rs. 900 million. He pointed out that the company he represents is functioning with great difficulty under the new management and had come under great disrepute due to the negative publicity, but Mendis Co. had paid the government a colossal Rs. 32 billion as taxes within eight years. Attorney Kolitha Dharmawardena said that not only their officers, but even the customers of Medis Co. had been summoned to the CID to obtain statements, making it difficult for the company to carry out their operations.", "intro": "The CID had notified the Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday that State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe had accepted Rs. 3 million in cheques from W.M.

{"topic": "\"Bharatha faction fired first, verdict given against Duminda", "date": "Jun 04, 2018", "full_news": "The appeal filed by former MP Duminda Silva requesting the Court to acquit him was taken for the 7th day today. The bench chaired by the Chief Justice Priyasad Dep. Making submissions, President Counsel Anura Meddegoda stated that although the High court verdict stated that former MP Duminda Silva ordered one of his guards to obtain a firearm, none of the witnesses has stated so. Quoting the High Court verdict, the President Counsel stated that the opinion of the Court was also that former MP Duminda Silva did not brandish a gun and intimidated the voters although such an accusation had been made against the former MP. Therefore he pointed out that former MP Duminda Silva should be acquitted from the charges of acting under a common agenda. The President Counsel stated that another charge had been made that former MP Duminda Silva assaulted an individual, the evidence of that incident was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. The President Counsel pointed out that the security guards of former MP Duminda Silva have returned fire as part of discharging their duty. They did so after the first shots were fired by the Bharatha Lakshman faction. He stated that the investigators have created false incidents with the intention of making former MP guilty although he is innocent in that incident. The President Counsel further stated that such factors were pointed out during the trial; however, they were not analyzed before convicting the former MP. The President Counsel who quoted the High Court verdict also said that the vital evidence including the Government Analyst&rsquo;s reports was not analyzed before issuing the verdict. President Counsel, Anura Meddegoda pointed out to the bench of Supreme Court Judges that under such circumstances, there is no any legitimacy in the verdict that convicted former MP Duminda Silva. On the previous hearings, the President Counsels proved before the Supreme Court that every evidence submitted in an attempt to make former MP Duminda Silva guilty were contradictory and, the Court verdict has stated itself that none of the evidence that was given during trial could be treated as 100 percent acceptable. They stated that Duminda Silva has been made guilty for some offenses that were not in the charge sheet and such action cannot be legal for whatsoever. They stated that there were contradictions and omissions in the evidence that were fabricated to make former MP Duminda Silva guilty. Although such contradictions and omissions were pointed out during the High Court trial, they were not properly treated before giving the verdict. They further pointed out that the CID has filed forged charges against former MP Duminda Silva by creating fabricated incidents. The President Counsels pointed out that former MP Duminda Silva was indicted for using firearms but no any evidence was submitted during the trial. They said that the Bharatha Lakshman faction had first started the shooting where former MP Duminda Silva became a victim, that incident was neglected in giving the verdict. The President Counsel said that it was proved well by sufficient evidence that former MP Duminda Silva was shot at first. However, the High Court verdict has stated that that incident was no pertinent and, it was the best example to that effect. They also said that judicial medical reports have also confirmed that former MP Duminda Silva received gunshots on his forehead. He said the High court verdict has been given not on the submissions or evidence made before the Court but it has been given merely on former MP Duminda Silva\u2019s popular political recognition. They said although the verdict is read one hundred thousand times, it is not possible to understand why former MP Duminda Silva has been convicted. Therefore the president counsels proved before the Supreme Court that the High court verdict that convicted former MP Duminda Silva is not legitimate at all. They said the High court judge has given the verdict, without examining whether the evidence is proved beyond reasonable doubt but based on the opinions submitted by the state counsels. The President Counsels further pointed out before the Supreme Court that the High Court has ignored the submissions made by the Duminda Silva faction or the defence submissions and, has conducted the trial based on the fictitious incidents and evidence.

All he said, at noon on April 6, is that he would check to see that the letter has been received. More than 24 hours later, he has not provided even that confirmation. Meanwhile, Inner City Press later on April 6 asked Lacroix on the ramp to the turnstile Dujarric's eviction make it unable to get through if he was aware of the letters. He indicated that he is. So why no answer from Antonio Guterres' holdover spokesman Dujarric? Lacroix has now received another letter, from the \"Association Bharathi CCFT - Centre Culturel Franco Tamoul.\" If the past is any guide, he will stonewall on human rights and corruption issues by withholding even this response for three days, while continuing restrictions on the Press. Here is the text of the letter sent to Lacroix, to the UN in Geneva and to Inner City Press: TO JEAN-PIERRE LACROIX, UNDER SECRETARY GENERAL FOR UN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS, NEW YORK. OHCHR, Geneva Inner City Press 6 April 2018 Dear Mr. Lacroix, SRI LANKAN ARMY\u2019S FLOUTING OF VETTING AGREEMENT FOR UN PEACEKEEPERS We write to draw your attention to allegations that the Sri Lankan Army has deployed UN peacekeepers in violation of the vetting agreement it reached with the National Human Rights Commission, as well as their obligation to conduct their own due diligence process to ensure that those who may constitute a risk to peacekeeping are not sent out. The failure to abide by these commitments constitutes a mockery of the whole process. Below are also a few remedial steps we think should be taken now. The complaint regarding the vetting comes from no less than the country\u2019s National Human Rights Commission (HRCSL), a body appointed by the Government itself. You can see this complaint in a Sinhala letter from the HRCSL to the President of Sri Lanka in his capacity as commander in chief on the HRCSL website. The gist of it has been reported in English by exiled Sri Lankan journalists. It says that the HRCSL and the Sri Lankan Army signed an agreement in 2016 for the HRCSL to vet Sri Lanka\u2019s peacekeepers but the Army deployed 49 of them to Lebanon on 18 February 2018 before this process was complete and they had handed over all the information on them requested by the HRCSL. Indeed, some of the information requested by the HRCSL is said to be still pending. Ultimately the responsibility lies with your department for the vetting process in terms of the Secretary General\u2019s \u2018Zero Tolerance\u201d policy on Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA) as well as his new policy statement which he announced in 2017 \u201cSpecial Measures for Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse:\u00a0\u00a0A New Approach\u201d, which has clearly failed spectacularly again in Sri Lanka.\u00a0\u00a0According to the UN, it seeks to ensure that only \u201cindividuals with the highest standards of integrity, competence and efficiency\u201d are hired \u2013 this has not been the record with regard to Sri Lanka. You will note that to date there has been no criminal accountability for the 134 Sri Lankan peacekeepers sent home from Haiti in connection with systematic child sexual exploitation from 2004-7, which was confirmed by an OIOS investigation. Furthermore, if your department allows peacekeepers from any country to deploy before the vetting process in place is complete, then you are complicit in undermining the vetting process. We, therefore, call on DPKO: So what will the UN do? On the morning of April 6, Secretary General Antonio Guterres' spokesman Stephane Dujarric who evicted Inner City Press from the UN Press Briefing Room where the UN Correspondents Association was meeting blithely said, just go to UNCA. Well, no - Sri Lanka history here. Back in February 2018 Lacroix was informed of the troubling past history in 2008 in Sri Lanka of a commander that country is seeking to deploy to the UN in Lebanon as early as February 18, Rathnappuli Wasantha Kumara Hewage, Inner City Press was informed and exclusively reported on February 14, and got confirmed from the UN on February 15. Now on February 19, UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said that following questions, the deployment of Hewage has been suspended. Video here; transcript: \"We were asked last week about a Sri Lankan officer who was scheduled to deploy to the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL.\u00a0\u00a0I can confirm that the officer\u2019s deployment is on hold pending a review of the matter.\u00a0\u00a0A decision regarding deployment of this officer will be made once the review is complete. We are in communication with the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka regarding the officer\u2019s background and Sri Lanka is cooperating fully with our inquiries. The United Nations takes reports of potential human rights violations very seriously.\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of policy, we are committed to ensuring that all personnel serving with the UN meet the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, including respect for and commitment to human rights.\" But why not canceled, given his record? We'll have more on this. When Lacroix held a rare press conference on January 24, Inner City Press asked him how the UN is vetting \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d from Cameroon, as that country's army is burning down whole villages in the Anglophone zones. Lacroix insisted that vetting is intensive. Inner City Press asked about what sources tell it, that the ostensibly vetting of troops from Sri Lanka, after the bloodbath on the beach there, consists of one OHCHR staffer in Geneva. Lacroix said he wasn't sure on that. Video here. After the press conference Inner City Press was contacted, and ultimately copied on a letter to Lacroix, below. On February 15, Inner City Press asked UN Spokesman Stephane Dujarric, UN transcript here: Inner City Press: there's been a letter sent by\u2026 by a number of Tamil Sri Lankan groups to Mr. [Jean-Pierre] Lacroix about the\u2026 the impending\u2026 I guess, some type of a commander in UNIFIL [United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon], Mr. [Rathnappuli Wasantha Kumara] Hewage.\u00a0\u00a0And they've documented to him \u2014 he's supposed to deploy on Sunday \u2014 that, in fact, he was present during 2008 in Kilinochchi, 2009 in PTK.\u00a0\u00a0These were, you know, highly controversial military actions.\u00a0\u00a0So, their complaint is that, in the past, Office of Human Rights of the UN would vet people, and now that doesn't appear to be the case anymore just by\u2026\u00a0\u00a0Have you seen that letter? Spokesman:\u00a0\u00a0We've\u2026 DPKO [Department of Peacekeeping Operations] has, indeed, received the letter you mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0They are looking into the case of the gentleman that you mentioned with\u2026 who's scheduled be deployed to Lebanon.\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of policy, we're committed to ensuring that all personnel serving with the UN meet the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity, including respect for and commitment to human rights.\u00a0\u00a0In accordance with existing policy, the UN should neither select nor deploy for service any individual who has been involved in violations of international human rights or humanitarian law.\u00a0\u00a0In reviewing the background of personnel to be deployed, we consider available information from within and outside of the UN system, thus, will review carefully the information that has been provided to us.\u00a0\u00a0Member States that provide UN personnel to peacekeeping operations also have the responsibility to certify that the personnel they nominate have not been involved, by act or omission, in violations of international humanitarian or human rights law or have been repatriated on disciplinary grounds from any UN operation.\u00a0\u00a0In cases where we have concerns regarding the human rights record of specific troop-contributing countries, we put in place additional measures to ensure that the personnel deployed is in line with the UN human rights screening policy. Inner City Press: one follow-up, because I remember Mr. Lacroix specifically commented on this when he did his press conference.\u00a0\u00a0Seems like these\u2026 these\u2026 these groups are saying that, in the past, the UN review these in Geneva, and now they're relying on Sri Lanka's own human rights commission, and they say the last people were deployed\u2026 Spokesman:\u00a0\u00a0I think from what I understood of what I just said, we review both what the Government tells us and external and internal sources.\" We'll see. Here was the letter, c/o Debbie Berman, Copy to OHCHR, Geneva and InnerCityPress: Dear Mr. Lacroix, STOP DEPLOYMEMNT OF UN PEACEKEEPER WITH FRONTLINE COMBAT EXPERIENCE IN SRI LANKA\u2019S 2009 WAR - This is to request you to stop the planned deployment to Lebanon on Sunday 18 February 2018 of a Sri Lankan contingent commander with frontline combat command experience in the final phase of the civil war in 2008-9. We believe that under the UN\u2019s current vetting criteria, this commander should have been screened out of all UN peacekeeping duties. We note that the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka has been asked to vet UN peacekeepers from Sri Lanka but consider that ultimately the responsibility lies with your department, as according to the UN, it seeks to ensure that only \u201cindividuals with the highest standards of integrity, competence and efficiency\u201d are hired. The Sri Lankan Army says Lt. Col. Rathnappuli Wasantha Kumara Hewage is due to head the 12th Force Protection Company (FPC) for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) An online search of Lt. Col. Hewage reveals he was involved in the assault on Kilinochchi town in Northern Sri Lanka on 22 December 2008 and located in PTK in late February 2009.\" Inner City Press accompanied and covered Ban Ki-moon's trip to Sri Lanka in 2009, and subsequent acceptance of Shavendra Silva as a senior UN Peacekeeping adviser.

On Wednesday, a court also halted the proposed expansion of the company. Vedanta has denied all the allegations against it and says it plans to double the capacity of its plant. Activists have criticised the police for firing live rounds at the protesters. \"We fired live ammunition in the air to disperse the protesters. But the mob continued to pelt stones and bombs.

Given below is the social media appeal in question: Public Appeal from the Children's Heart Centre, Lady Ridgeway Hospital The following appeal is by Dr. Xxxxxxx xxxxx a child heart specialist working at the Children\u2019s Heart Centre at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children in Colombo. 09th April 2018 Each day around 3-5 heart surgeries are carried out on little ones from all parts of our country free of charge. I would say that 85% of the parents of these children are from a very poor socio-economic backgrounds, and even find providing basics for their families an uphill task. Once the child is admitted to the ICU following cardiac surgery, the parents are requested to provide pampers for the child which could range from 4-10 pampers per day, and sometimes for 1-2 weeks or even longer, depending on the length of their stay in the ICU. This has placed a tremendous financial burden on these parents as a pamper costs Rs. 50 (purchased retail), who can barely afford the bus fare to come and visit their children in hospital. Recently, there were incidents where parents had even resorted to desperate measures such as stealing pampers from others as they have been unable to afford them on their own. The hospital requires approx. 4000 pampers per month. I wish to earnestly request you to look into the possibility of assisting us in providing a solution to this hidden problem.

Everest Expeditions. For the past few weeks, Johann has been performing a series of climbing rotations which prepare the climbers for higher altitudes and the Himalayan terrain. Johann has completed three such training rotations, climbing all the way up to Camp 3 which is 7,162m above sea level and the fourth highest peak in the world. He has also been undergoing a series of ladder training exercises and other glacier-trekking exercises to help him prepare for the final stage of his Everest climb. Johann and other climbers have been experiencing bad weather throughout the current climbing season, and it is hoped the jet streams at the summit will ease in time for the final summit ascent. This last phase of Johann\u2019s climb is the most treacherous and also most challenging \u2013 the area beyond Camp 4 and the Summit is known as the Death Zone because of its perilous conditions, where strong winds, narrow plateaus, steep ridges await the climbers and because in this zone the organs of the body start to slowly shut down because of the depleted oxygen saturation in the air. Johann has been in intense training for this climb since December 2017. This is Johann\u2019s second attempt to summit Mount Everest. In April 2016, he and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala were the first Sri Lankans to attempt to summit the peak, but Johann was forced to turn back at 8,400m, a mere 448m short of reaching the summit, due to technical difficulties with his equipment. Kuru-Utumpala went on to complete the climb, becoming the first Sri Lankan to scale Mt. Everest.

The full text of his commemorative message is as follows : The LTTE organization which saw its birth in 1983 as a minor group grew to be one of the most ruthless terrorist organizations in the world by the year 2009. LTTE organization, equipped with infantry, fire-power, naval strength and a certain degree of air power gained world-wide\u00a0 notoriety as the terrorist group which inducted the 'suicide bomb' concept to the world. The unfailing commitment, tireless dedication, bravery and courage as well as proper planning of Army, Navy and Air Force members enabled them to rescue thousands of innocent Tamil civilians, used as human shields and win over the LTTE which has by then taken to a cycle of terrorism with the support of the international Diaspora for creation of an Eelam state. Accordingly, terrorism was completely eradicated on 19 May 2009 after capturing the last patch of land, held by terrorists. Towards it, Sri Lanka Police and Civil Security Department also made an invaluable contribution. War Heroes of the Army (23,962), Navy (1160), Air Force (443), together with 2598 Policemen and 456 Civil Security Department members made the supreme sacrifice in defence of the Motherland, thus enabling all Sri Lankans to enjoy the present day's spirits of freedom. All of them sacrificed their tomorrow for our today while defending the sovereignty, territorial integrity and the unitary status of Sri Lanka. Likewise, the selfless contribution and sacrifices made by all Sri Lankans who were under threat of LTTE terrorism for 30 years is worth recalling here. Not only that, all Sri Lankans as of today lead their lives freely, thanks to the fulfillment of timely responsibilities of our political leadership. Nine years have passed by 19 May 2018 since the eradication of terrorism from our soil. I firmly believe the freedom thus gained should be shared not by exaggerated glorification or through mere rhetoric and hyperbole but by showing our sentiments of deep gratitude to fallen Tri Service, Police, Civil Security Department members and civilians who rooted terrorism out. Great War Heroes, pertinent to mention here, must not therefore be manipulated to serve narrow objectives and personal agendas, nor should they be incited to resort to emotional and anti-social acts. Sri Lanka Army in order to pay tribute and commemorate fallen War Heroes has launched a special programme. Accordingly, religious observances in commemoration of them have been organized at all regimental formations, followed by reading of my special message of tribute. Besides, National War Heroes' Day commemoration, headed by HE the President Maithripala Sirisena, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces will take place on Saturday (19) at the National War Heroes' Monument in Battaramulla, followed by a mega Army-supported 'Aaloka Pooja' Pinkama, the same evening at the historic Kelaniya Rajamaha Viharaya premises. Many numbers of fearless War Heroes during the course of 30 years sacrificed their valuable lives, sweat and blood to decide on our future. They all sighed their last breath to the air on that day, expecting ever-lasting bonds of peace and reconciliation would prevail. They would ever never have wished the recurrence of a war even in a dream during their cycle of future births. Therefore, as envisaged by them in the past, we should pursue wisely, avoid recurrence of any war at all and preserve hard-earned freedom for generations, still to be born. At this moment, I wish all brave War Heroes who sacrificed their lives for protection of the country's unitary status and precious lives of the general public attain supreme bliss of Nibbhana. Similarly, let me wish speedy recovery to all differently able War Heroes still under recuperation\u00a0\u00a0 and medical treatment.

{"topic": "'Duminda convicted by creating false incidents\u2019", "date": "May 19, 2018", "full_news": "During a shooting incident on October 08, 2011 at the LG elections in Kolonnawa, four persons were killed, including MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra, while several others including MP Duminda Silva sustained injuries. In the subsequent case pertaining to the incident, Duminda Silva and three others were found guilty and handed the death sentence. However, Duminda Silva and the other convicted persons had filed an appeal which was taken up yesterday (18), while his lawyers had told court that the investigating officers had created false incidents in order to convict Duminda Silva. The appeal filed seeking his acquittal and release was taken up yesterday for the 6th day before a five member Supreme Court bench including Chief Justice Priyasad Dep. In his deliberations, President\u2019s Counsel Anura Meddegoda said as there was no validity in the court verdict, there is no legal impact. He told court that the CID had obtained the signature of the third accused on three documents forcibly, citing a statement made by the defendant in court. The President\u2019s Counsel pointed out that the special statement of the defendant had been accepted as a reliable statement, by the judges of the High Court. The President\u2019s Counsel further stated that based on the information obtained from the said suspect, the CID had produced two weapons in court, claiming that it was found based on the information given by the suspect. The President\u2019s Counsel stressed that the arrest of the suspect, discovery of the weapons and all other incidents were those cooked up by the CID, noting that through that they had levelled false allegations against Duminda Silva. \u00a0 However, President\u2019s Counsel Anura Meddegoda told court that in delivering the\u00a0 verdict, the Court had failed to analyse these falsely cooked up incidents properly. In previous appeal hearings, President\u2019s Counsel Anuja Premaratne had stated that although the disparities and shortcomings of the false evidence cooked up to convict Duminda Silva, was pointed out in court, these were not taken into consideration in determining\u00a0 the verdict. The PC further noted that Duminda Silva had been convicted for charges that were not included in the charge sheet, which was totally illegal. He told the Supreme Court that in the verdict it was accepted that all incidents presented to convict Duminda Silva had many disparities in evidence, and that\u00a0 the evidence of the witnesses could not be fully accepted. Under such circumstances, it was not justifiable or legitimate to have convicted Duminda Silva on any of the charges, the President\u2019s Counsel told the five member Supreme Court panel. President\u2019s Counsel Anuja Premaratne noted that the conviction had been made based on the fact that Duminda Silva was a popular political figure and not on the evidence presented and even though the verdict was read a thousand times, it was imposible to determine on what grounds he was convicted. Hence, he noted that the verdict that convicted Duminda Silva is certainly not an acceptable verdict. Meanwhile, President\u2019s Counsel Anil Silva said there are many shortcomings in the verdict issued by the Colombo High Court. He noted that the Judge had issued the verdict based purely on the statements of the AG\u2019s Department attorneys, without having considered if the charges were being proved without a reasonable doubt. He pointed out that although Duminda Silva was charged of having used firearms, no evidence was submitted in court to substantiate\u00a0 these allegations. The President\u2019s Counsel noted that although it was Bharatha Lakshman\u2019s party that had first opened fire that injured Duminda Silva, but this fact was not taken into consideration during the issuing of the verdict. A good example of the partiality of this case was that despite it being proved during the court proceedings that Duminda Silva was first shot, it was noted in the verdict that this fact was irrelevant, the President\u2019s Counsel noted. He said it was confirmed by the JMO\u2019s report that Duminda Silva had sustained gun shot injuries to the front of his head. The President\u2019s Counsel further noted that the High Court had convicted Silva based on the falsely cooked up incidents and evidence and had ignored the evidence presented from the defence evidence. He said this case that was filed to tarnish the image of Duminda Silva, adding that he had not received a fair trial which is the right of every citizen. Accordingly, President\u2019s Attorney Anil Silva appealed to the Supreme Court to exonerate Duminda Silva from all charges and\u00a0 release him.

The President Counsel said that such benefits of the doubt should have been given to the Duminda Silva faction but the Judge has neglected to do so. In addition, the President Counsel logically proved that incidents were concocted intending to make Duminda Silva guilty. He pointed out that the shooting at Duminda Silva was instigated by Bharatha Lakshman faction. However such action was completely overlooked by the judge when she issued her verdict. President Counsel Anil de Silva further pointed out before the Supreme Court that the High Court has ignored the say by the Duminda Silva faction or Defence submissions and has conducted trial solely based on the fictitious incidents and evidence. He said that this Case was filed to tarnish the image of former MP Duminda Silva, therefore, he was denied of a justifiable trial similar to that of any other citizen is entitled to in this Case. Therefore, President Counsel Anil Silva requested the Supreme Court to overrule the verdict which has unlawfully sentenced former MP Duminda Silva and acquit him from all the charges. Later, the Case was taken before the bench of 5 Supreme Court judges again for the third day today. Making submissions before the Court, President Counsel Anuja Premarathna also stated that the verdict given against former MP Duminda Silva was unlawful. The President Counsel who pointed out the shortcomings of the verdict under 10 factors said that the verdict was given neither on the evidence nor on the submissions. He said it was given on the fact that Duminda Silva is a popular political icon. He further said that although the verdict is read one hundred thousand times, it is not possible to understand why Duminda Silva has been convicted. The President Counsel said that the shortcomings and contradictions of the false evidence that created to make Duminda Silva guilty, have been marked during the trial. Quoting the evidence of the High Court, the President Counsel stated that the Court did not explain the reason to not consider such doubts before it gave a unilateral verdict. He said that the High Court has given a sentence for possessing a firearm without any evidence to prove it. The President Counsel said that the verdict by the High Court itself has stated that a single Judge of the three-member bench has no authority to mete out punishment. Thus, President Counsel Anuja Premarathna proved before the bench of five Supreme Court Judges that the verdict which convicted former MP Duminda Silva is neither an actual nor an authentic verdict. The Appeal will be called again for further trial on this Thursday.

The public can pay homage to these Relics at Temple Trees in Colombo from April 28 to May 2, 2018. A specially made casket secures these two most revered and authentic Relics. The first Relic, enclosed within the silver casket enshrined in Vihara, were found by Sir John Marshall in 1913-14 near the ancient city of Taxila (Takshasila). They were found in a small Buddhist chapel close to the Dharmarajika Stupain, a silver reliquary with inscriptions dating the year 136 (circa 79 A.D).\u00a0 They were recorded as the relics of the Blessed One. The second Relic enshrined at Sarnath was found by Mr. A. H. Longhurst of Archaeological Survey of India in 1929 in a large Stupa at Nagarjunakonda in the Guntur District of the then Madras Presidency. The Stupa in which the Relic was found is described as the Maha Chetiyaor viz. the 'Great Stupa' of the Blessed One. In a statement, the Indian High Commission says, \"The Sacred Relics of Sarnath are yet another manifestation of the shared Buddhist heritage of India and Sri Lanka, which forms a spiritual bond between our two nations. These Relics are enshrined at Mulagandhakuti Vihara at Saranth in India. Sarnath is historically significant since Lord Buddha preached his first sermon there. Anagarika Dharmapala, founder of the Maha Bodhi Society of India, played a key role in building Mulagandhakuti Vihara to restore the glory of Sarnath. The land and the Sacred Relics were gifted to the Maha Bodhi Society of India by the Government of India.\" The High Commission of India thanks the Mahabodhi Society of India for loaning these Sacred Relics for exposition in Colombo. This is the second time that the High Commission of India has taken an initiative to exhibit the sacred relics of Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.

{"topic": "Scientists discover dozens of new genes for hair colour", "date": "Apr 24, 2018", "full_news": "A test based on the new genetic markers was 10-20% more accurate than existing forensic tests and was most reliable for red or black hair, with brown or blond hair proving harder to predict, researchers said. \u201cIf someone leaves blood at a crime scene, you could say from their DNA whether they had black or red hair with about 90% certainty,\u201d said Tim Spector, a lead author on the work at King\u2019s College London. The colour of a person\u2019s hair is one of the most heritable features of their appearance, with studies on twins suggesting that genetics explains up to 97% of hair colour. Until now scientists have known of only 13 genes that affect where an individual\u2019s hair will lie on the scale from light to dark. After studying the DNA of nearly 300,000 people, researchers from King\u2019s and Erasmus MC in Rotterdam uncovered 124 genes that contributed to hair colour, either by directly affecting the production and distribution of the natural pigment melanin or through other biological mechanisms, many of which are still unclear. The fresh haul of hair colour genes explain 35% of red hair, 25% of blond hair and 26% of black hair, according to the study, reported in the journal Nature Genetics. It is likely that hundreds of other genes also affect hair colour in ways that were too subtle for the scientists to detect. One factor that complicates a forensic test for hair colour is the common tendency for children who are born blond to have their hair turn brown a handful of years later. While that change itself could well be driven by genes, the researchers found none that seemed to explain the effect. \u201cWe know that some blond kids become brown but we have no idea why that is,\u201d said Manfred Kayser, a senior author on the paper at Erasmus MC. Perhaps more intriguing was the discovery of marked differences in hair colour among the men and women who took part in the study. The scientists, who drew on data gathered by the UK BioBank and the US genetics company 23andMe, found that women were 25% more likely to report having blond hair than men, and three times less likely to say they had dark hair. While the scientists cannot rule out that some participants were mistaken about their own hair colour, the numbers are in line with findings from other studies that used optical instruments to measure hair colour. In the past the differences have been attributed to sexual preferences, with women supposedly preferring darker men and men preferring blond women. \u201cIf this was going on, it\u2019s hard to prove,\u201d said Kayser. Beyond casting light on the biology of human hair colour, the research gives scientists fresh insights into genes linked to diseases such as skin cancer. \u201cPigments are far more than just cosmetic \u2013 they are important for the immune system and play a role in many diseases,\u201d said Spector. \u201cUnderstanding the genetics could lead to new therapies.\u201d (theguardian.com)", "intro": "Forensic scientists are a step closer to predicting the colour of a suspect\u2019s hair from their DNA alone after the discovery of more than 100 new genes that influence the shade of a person\u2019s locks.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/8281-scientists-discover-dozens-of-new-genes-for-hair-colour"},

The expectation of the Government is to reduce the tobacco usage up to 15% in the next 4 years to prevent the 6,000 deaths. According to the WHO-Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the international tobacco control treaty, for which Sri Lanka is a Party, tobacco packaging and labeling policies have emerged as prominent and cost-effective tobacco control measures. Although packaging policies have primarily focused on health warnings, there is growing recognition of the importance of packaging as a marketing tool for the tobacco industry. Plain Packaging requires the removal of all branding (colours, imagery, corporate logos and trademarks, permitting manufacturers to print only the brand name in a mandated size, font and place on the pack, in addition to the health warnings and any other legally mandated information such as toxic constituents and tax-paid stamps. The appearance of all tobacco packs is standardized, including the colour of the pack. The removal of branding on cigarette packaging aims to deter smoking by removal of positive associations of brands (including design and symbol) with the consumption of tobacco. It also aims to remove an available avenue of brand advertising for cigarette companies. Australia was the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging, with all packets sold from 1 December 2012 being sold in logo-free, drab dark brown packaging. There has been opposition from tobacco companies to plain packaging laws, some of which have sued the Australian government. Since the Australian government won the court cases, several other countries have enacted plain packaging laws.

There are conflicting reports about the level of efficiency, with internal sources maintaining it has dropped as low as 40 percent. But a spokesman for the Power and Energy Ministry downplayed the problem. The ESP is also called an electrostatic air cleaner. It is a filtration device that removes fine particles\u2013in this case, fly ash\u2013from a flowing gas. \u201cThe ESP has sixteen fields to filter ash,\u201d said Sulakshana Jaywardena, the Ministry\u2019s Director (Development). \u201cFive are not working but the other eleven are functioning. If you visit the plant, you can see the flame and that the issue is not so bad.\u201d He confirmed, however, that the Ceylon Electricity Board\u2019s (CEB) Deputy General Manager had requested permission from its General Manager to shut down the unit\u2013the coal power plant\u2019s oldest one, having been commissioned in 2011\u2013to facilitate repairs. \u201cIf there is a considerable issue, we will shut down and do the repair,\u201d he said. But the Wayamba Provincial Council Environmental Authority (WPCEA) has clearly instructed the CEB to fix the problem now. \u201cWe have been giving them time,\u201d said Saman Lenaduwa, the Authority\u2019s head. \u201cWe will stop giving them excuses hereafter. They will have to shut down the plant, if necessary, and do the repairs.\u201d A meeting in this regard was held on Thursday. \u201cIt is not a question of how many are not working,\u201d an environmentalist said, requesting anonymity. \u201cEven if one field is broken, you are not meeting the required conditions and, therefore, clearly violating legal requirements. Why is Lakvijaya measured with a different yardstick to other organisations in the country?\u201d Lakvijaya has also been running with a valid environmental protection licence (EPL) since June last year. But the old one clearly specifies that particulate matter must be below 150 milligrams per cubic metre (mg/Nm3). \u201cThe particulate matter output in untreated flue gas is 12332 mg/Nm3,\u201d the environmentalist said. \u201cTo get it below 150 mg/Nm3 which is the national standard, the minimum ESP efficiency should be around 99%.\u201d Another vital environmental protection device called the flue-gas desulphurizer (FGD) was also broken for ten days and repaired only this week, internal sources said. This was confirmed by the WPCEA but denied by the Ministry. This instrument removes sulphur dioxide from the flue gas. The FGD in question is also in unit 1. \u201cWe have a seawater FGD,\u201d said the environmentalist earlier quoted. \u201cThe smoke out of the boiler first goes through the ESP which removes the dust by using electrostatic charges. The seawater FDG then removes the sulphur dioxide from the filtered smoke. The problem is that the FGD will not work properly if the ESP is not functioning well.\u201d Fly ash is toxic, he pointed out. With the ESP not working at optimum levels, part of this matter gets discharged into the ocean. \u201cSo now we have sea pollution on top of the ESP problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout the FGD, the pollution is in the atmosphere. With it, it\u2019s in the sea. Either way it\u2019s bad. And the CEB still hasn\u2019t shut down the unit to fix the ESP.\u201d The activist pointed to another environmental issue at Norochcholai. \u201cThe cooling towers need a lot of water,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is obtained through three ocean intakes.

Rather, data aggregators are able to supplement companies with data they may not otherwise have, allowing marketers and Facebook itself to work together to better target users. For instance, a company like Pepsi is able to advertise on Facebook using information gleaned from Facebook profiles, information it owns like email addresses, and information it purchases from data aggregators like Experian, which gathers together purchasing history and other valuable information. As part of Partner Categories, Facebook shares revenue with companies like Experian that help inform its data set every time a marketer purchases ad space on Facebook using that data.

Their Queensland hometown of Biloela had been campaigning for their return ever since they were removed from their home early one morning. The family of four remain in detention, pending a hearing in early May. Their 5,500-strong hometown community has organised a petition that has collected more than 76,000 signatures, calling on Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton to grant them the right to stay. Nadesalingam and Priya - who met and married in Australia - arrived separately by boat in 2012 and 2013 respectively, after fleeing Sri Lanka's civil war. \"Nades faces persecution for his former association with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which was defeated by the Sri Lankan armed forces,\" said Ben Hillier, a Tamil Refugee Council spokesperson. Nadesalingam's application for asylum has been rejected by Australian authorities. Priya had been granted bridging visas and although she was expecting another, the last had just run out when police and Australian Border Force officers raided their home just before dawn on 5 March. Family friend and social worker Angela Fredericks, who started the petition, told the BBC: \"It was done in such secrecy. They were given 10 minutes to pack up their lives.\" Nadesalingam was getting ready for work at a local meat factory and Priya was warming a bottle of milk for the baby when authorities entered their home at 05:00. Nine-month-old Dharuniga and Kopiga, two, were separated from their parents and the whole family were taken 1,500km from Queensland to Melbourne. In Melbourne they said they were told they could not call anyone until they signed documents agreeing to their deportation. After two days they signed the papers and then called their local community doctor to tell them of their plight. On Tuesday, over a week after their initial arrest, the family were then flown on separate flights from Melbourne to Perth. \u00a0 It was only when they were put on the plane bound from Perth to Sri Lanka with other Tamil deportees that the injunction was applied and the family were taken off. It was filed by their lawyers but the grounds are not known. The family are currently in a detention centre in Perth, 4,475 km from their Queensland home. Mr Hillier said of Tuesday's deportation attempt: \"This was a dastardly and reprehensible action. Dharuniga and Kopiga were born in Australia.

Dozens of people gathered on Wednesday evening for a vigil at a local park where Priya would bring her girls to meet other children.

Born in Negombo, Sri Lanka he had initially attended the Nainamaduwa Roman Catholic school later St. Joseph Vaz College in Wennappuwa after Grade V. Having got through his A/L examination in the Math stream in 1977, he could not enter university. However, he joined the Fisheries Corporation as a technical officer. Subsequently, having gone to Italy through a connection, he had paved his way right up to becoming an regional MP in Italy. Explaining his journey in Italy, he said, \u201cIt was when I arrived in Italy that I understood that it was not possible to get a job here with the qualifications I had gained from Sri Lanka. All those who come to Italy from other countries only get to do minor jobs. I too had to work in homes, restaurants and other menial jobs. It was a very tough time. Then I got a job as an assistant at a modeling agency, where I worked for two years. Then I got a job as a caretaker of an apartment complex. That was a good break for me and I worked there for 18 years. However, in 2007 I lost that job. Then I returned to Sri Lanka in 2007 and engaged in business.\u201d Having married a Philippine lady as he arrived in Italy initially, they have one daughter who had completed her initial studies in Italy and moved to London for higher education. She is currently married to a Sri Lankan. This is what he had to say about his election win. \u201cAfter 10 years of holding Italian citizenship, one can become a public representative. But, here its not like Sri Lanka. One must have studied political science to get into politics. My biggest challenge was the language and how to use it comprehensively. I attended classes in order to study these subjects. Otherwise, no one would have voted for me.\u201d \u201cThe Italian Democratic Party is a leftist party. There is also an association formed by the Sri Lankans here known as the People\u2019s public centre.\u201d This association maintains links with the Democratic Party and the party had notified that several migrants will be given the chance to contest. There were many who came forward from the Philippines, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, several African countries and Latin American countries. However, I was fortunate to receive nominations. There were four others from various countries that also contested this election. I contested from the Lombardy province, which is a very wealthy province. They did not have much regard for the leftist ideologies and we knew that. But we contested legally. Unlike in Sri Lanka there is no prolonged rallies and you don\u2019t have to spend millions. All I had to do was print my election manifesto and distribute it among the people. It only cost me 450 Euros, which is around 85,000. Our party gained 30% of the votes. Had the other minor parties not got such a low percentage, we could have joined up and won, but that is another fascinating story.\u201d \u201cAlthough there was an election on March 24, there was no loud sounds. Even if you win, you cannot make much noise. For example, if I were to meet the Health Minister at a shop to buy my bread, he would have to stand behind me if he came after me. Just because he is the minister he would not get any preferential treatment,\u201d explained Niranjan, next talking of his future plans. \u201cWhatever happens, Sri Lanka is my country of birth and I will return when I reach retirement. I love Sri Lanka, but I will never be able to enter Sri Lanka\u2019s mudslinging politics,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Sri Lanka, an election means causing a huge din but in Italy it is quite different.

But in June 2017, eleven residents of Layards Road filed a petition seeking to quash any preliminary planning clearance issued to Blue Ocean Breeze (Pvt) Ltd or D D Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) or the Colombo Municipality to erect a building of more than five floors. The basis of the legal challenge was that the plot on which Blue Ocean was putting up the highrise is a \u2018Special Primary Residential Zone\u2019 under the 2008 City of Colombo Development Plan (Amendment). The number of storeys allowed within such an area is five or ground plus four floors. In January this year, the residents once again petitioned the Court of Appeal for an interim order to prevent the developers from starting construction after learning that work was to begin soon. They sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the UDA or the municipality from issuing a fresh preliminary planning clearance or building permit for a construction exceeding five floors. They also want a writ of mandamus compelling the UDA or the municipality to demolish \u201can unauthorised construction\u201d should the developers proceed with the project, especially if it exceeds five floors. The petitioners express fear that, with the construction of an \u201cunauthorised high rise structure on the subject premises, the adjoining properties and buildings will suffer serious and irreparable damage including cracks to walls and foundations, quite apart from violation of applicable regulations and environmental concerns\u201d. But in a gazette dated January 18, 2018, Minister Champika Ranawaka (who also holds the portfolio of Western Development) has designated the front lots along the eastern side of Layards Road to be a \u2018Mixed Development Zone\u2019. This allows for the construction of offices, apartments, entertainment facilities and shops. The Minister\u2019s signature on the gazette is dated July 14, 2017, not long after the residents took the matter to court. The gazette gives effect to a revision of the City of Colombo Development Plan. The Urban Development Authority Law empowers the Minister to carry out periodic changes. The amendment now allows Blue Ocean to proceed with its project. The UDA rejected any suggestion that the amendment was introduced to favour a particular developer. But Chairman Jagath Nandana Munasinghe admitted that Blue Ocean made a request to implement the project in the Special Primary Residential Zone. \u201cThe developer pointed out that one side [western] of Layards Road is designated a Mixed Development Zone while the other side [eastern] is a Special Primary Residential Zone,\u201d Mr Munasinghe said. \u201cThe street is the boundary between the two and separate regulations apply to each side. However, the land value on both road-fronts is the same.\u201d There was no justification, he pointed out, for such a distinction to be maintained in the City of Colombo Development Plan when the land values on the eastern and western side of the road were the same. \u201cThe decision was not in favour of anyone,\u201d Mr Munasinghe said. \u201cThe UDA followed a procedure. The Act clearly prescribes how any changes to the Plan must be carried out. There may be certain development needs arising from time to time. These are referred to the Planning Committee appointed by the Minister and they make the decisions.\u201d The Committee, on policy grounds, ruled favourably on the developer\u2019s request, Mr Munasinghe said, adding that the change applies to all the lots facing Layards Road. This means other companies can now erect buildings on either side of the street. The Committee\u2019s outcome was referred to the Minister for validation through a gazette. The date of his signature was only \u201ca coincidence\u201d, Mr Munasinghe said. And the gazette was only issued in January because it \u201chad been lying in files\u201d at the UDA.

Currently, most of the weekend newspapers sell for around Rs. 60.00. According to Wijaya publications, the reason behind the price increase was the increase in printing paper in the international market, the rupee devaluation and high transport costs and increase in production costs. When we contacted Senior Journalist Kusal Perera regarding this sudden increase in price, he said, \u201cPeople don\u2019t buy the Lankadeepa newspaper to read the current news or for social value but they buy it for the advertisements.

He further stated, \u201cIn my view around 40% - 50% of the readers don\u2019t buy the Lankadeepa for its news value, but just for the advertisements on houses, lands and vehicles etc. Therefore, I don\u2019t think that the increase in the price of the newspaper will have a negative effect on its sales.\u201d \u201cHowever, the reasons cited by Wijaya publications for the increase is unjustified.

Most publishers used the papers to bargain with politicians. There is an electronic media institution that is clearly doing that at present. These electronic media institutions have no ethics and not an iota of shame. They use thuggery to do what they please. Even politicians believe that the media has such a power. Similarly there are those who launder their black money by using the media.

{"topic": "\u201cSri Lanka\u2019s courts double standards\u201d - UN Human", "date": "Feb 24, 2018", "full_news": "In his report on \"Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka\" to the 37th session of the Human Rights Council, which will be held from 26 February to 23 March 2018 in Geneva, the High Commissioner also called on Member States to explore other avenues, including the application of universal jurisdiction, that could foster accountability in Sri Lanka. \u201cA State\u2019s capacity or willingness to address impunity for gross violations and abuses of international human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law can, in part, be assessed by its approach to complex, serious cases,\u201d the UN High Commissioner charged. The death of 27 inmates during a security operation to control a riot at Welikada prison, in November 2012, the killing of protestors by army personnel at Weliwerya in August 2013, More than 10 years after the killing of five students in Trincomalee, in January 2006, and of 17 humanitarian workers of the non-governmental organization ACF, in Muttur, in August 2006, no noticeable progress has been made in ensuring accountability, the abduction and disappearance of 11 persons during 2008-2009, On 24 December 2016, the five defendants on trial for the murder of Member of Parliament Nadarajah Raviraj, Prageeth Ekneligoda\u2019s abduction and disappearance in 2010, the mass murder in Kumarapuram in 1996, and Lasantha\u2019s killing in 2009 are among the list of unresolved crimes. He notes that in almost all of these unresolved cases, almost all the security forces personnel involved have been released on bail. \u201cAn overall trait of the Sri Lankan justice system is the perceived double standards in the administation of justice with regard to treatment of State officials or security personnel accused in criminal proceedings,\u201d he pointed out.\u00a0 Hence, the argument of appointing a special court comprising specialised officers and international lawyers to take measures against state officials and military personnel who have committed grave crimes, is further justified, he said. A case not related to human rights violations but that illustrates the contradictions of the criminal justice system is the conviction, on 7 September 2017, of a former presidential secretary and a former director general of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission in a corruption case. Within hours of their entry into prison, both convicted officials had been relocated to the prison hospital, reportedly for health reasons. Ordinary convicts often complain of the difficulties they encounter in receiving medical treatment in prison, even for easily verifiable or urgent problems such as infections. On 20 September, the two convicts were released on bail \u201cunder exceptional circumstances\u201d by a Colombo High Court judge, after having served only 13 days of their 3-year prison term. This is exceptional in a system where suspects are often held on remand awaiting trial for up to 10 years, the report noted. On 28 August 2017, several Latin American human rights groups, coordinated by aninternational non-governmental organization, filed criminal complaints in Brazil andColombia, under the universal jurisdiction doctrine, against the then Ambassador of SriLanka to countries in the region, retired Army General Jagath Jayasuriya, for war crimesand crimes against humanity allegedly committed in the final phase of the civil war, in2009. The ambassador completed his tenure in the region and returned to Sri Lanka on 30August. An overall trait of the Sri Lankan justice system is the perceived double standards in the administration of justice with regard to treatment of State officials or security personnel accused in criminal proceedings. While the situation of human rights in Sri Lanka has improved overall since January 2015, there have been fewer signs of progress since the previous report of the High Commissioner. Several incidents targeting religious minorities, slow government reaction and response to some of those incidents and the controversial statements of some (then) key ministers have eroded the Government\u2019s image of being fully committed to improving the human rights situation. The High Commissioner remains gravely concerned that, 2 1/2 years into a reconciliation process, his Office continues to receive reports of harassment or surveillance of human rights defenders and victims of human rights violations. The preconditions of trust and confidence that are needed for a reconciliation agenda to succeed are incompatible with intrusive, and likely unnecessary, surveillance of activists. While the High Commissioner has repeatedly been assured that those incidents were not consistent with the Government\u2019s policy, the inability to fully eliminate such practices is alarming. During the period under review, at least two incidents escalated to physical violence against the activist being threatened or kept under surveillance. \u201cWhile the Government has managed to steer many of these worrying events in a positive direction, this type of violence in a country that has experienced cycles of extreme violence roughly every 10 years is deeply troubling, particularly when accompanied by hate speech, misinformation and agitation through social media and political manipulation. The continuing allegations of torture and surveillance and the lack of sufficient progress in implementing critical confidence-building measures, such as the release of land, the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the solution to the pending cases under the Act, have antagonized key constituencies that could be instrumental to the Government\u2019s reform efforts. The High Commissioner urges the Human Rights Council to continue to play a critical role in encouraging progress in accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka,\u201d he said noting that it also calls on Member States to explore other avenues, including the application of universal jurisdiction that could foster accountability.", "intro": "The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein criticizing Sri Lanka\u2019s judiciary system said the country was following a contradictory mechanism in issues concerning suspected state and military officers and asked international powers to take stern action on war crimes and human rights violations.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/7401-sri-lanka-s-courts-double-standards-un-human-rights-chief"},

Today's discussion has been initiated while signatures are being obtained from United National Party (UNP) MPs, pledging their support for Mr. Wickremesinghe to remain as PM. Meanwhile, a powerful MP of the Joint Opposition (JO) said that 102 signatures have been obtained from MPs of the JO and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to appoint senior SLFP leader - Nimal Siripala de Silva as the Premier. It is said that the list also includes the names of UNP MPs - Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Chathura Senaratne. The JP MP further said that the president had promised them to give the backing of 17 MPs for this cause. Meanwhile in a Facebook post, UNP state minister Palitha Range Bandara has said that he will never join former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and not to fall for false rumours. Meanwhile, it is reported that a group of 20 MPs led by minister Susil Premajayantha are to crossover to the JO tomorrow (19). Political sources further say that it was planned to issue a sudden gazette notification. After inquiring from the government press, we learnt that although there was initially a plan to do so, the measure was later suspended by the Presidential Secretariat. Upon questioning a JO MP on the true reason behind the attempt to remove Mr. Wickremesinghe, he said all this was being done due to the 2020 Presidential election. As Mahinda Rajapaksa is unable to contest again for a presidential election, according to the constitution, Mr. Wickremesinghe remains the only prominent political figure wielding at least 30% of the public mandate, he added. Elaborating, he said that the president wished to eliminate Mr. Wickremesinghe from the 2020 Presidential election altogether and the JO will support this move as it is also advantageous to them. Eliminating Mr. Wickremesinghe now would mean the JO would be able to field a candidate who can defeat president Maithripala Sirisena despite not being that politically mature, he further clarified.", "intro": "Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe & Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had gone to the President's official residence a short while ago.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/7291-premiership-crisis-deepens"},

Dr. Karunaratne, an experienced engineer, has gained international repute due to his involvement in many engineering projects including the Semaku Ocean island in Singapore.

One such local travel company has given credit amounting to US$ 2 million to a Chinese travel agent and is now in serious financial trouble, he said adding that the accumulated credit of some of these local tour operators under this set up would be more than $10 million easily.   \u201cWorking with Chinese agents has a credit risk at large. Ideal scenario is to recover the full payment in advance or 60-80 percent prior to the tour\u201d, SLAITO observed.

However when credit is extended a very close tab on payments is needed on the business handled and future business as well, he suggested.    Each company will have to carry out their own back ground checks on Chinese agents and extend credit accordingly, SLAITO emphasised.    Businesses are run individually and each company has to check credit worthiness and manage the incoming business and payments receivables with a very close control of outstanding payments, SLAITO said noting that it should not be allowed to go beyond the extended credit limit strictly.

This is the 21st century, not the 15th. Women must have rights as equal to men. If the president sees fit for women to not receive liquor then he must pass a law to ensure the same for men. After all, a president shouldn't be one who sees things in a sexist way. The president needs to see things from the standpoint of equality. He must make sure that all genders receive the same. It is hard to think that as a country in the 21st century that such a law was even discussed. That there are still people who believe themselves to be superior because of their gender identification. The reasoning for the matter was stated as \"women need to wake up early to cook breakfast but how will they do it if they aren't sober enough?\" It has been proven that women have more self control than men as they are taught many responsibilities as children. Other than that fact, one should learn how to cook for themselves no matter what gender because one's sexism nor feminism will help you when you are starving. Liquor is injurious to health and because of that I believe that this law should apply for all genders, but that aside I don't believe that it should be applied to only one gender because of your sexism. This country has many types of issues. The ones regarding sexism are so subtle that even women support them. This shows how the small issues that go unnoticed can cause bigger problems. Girls from a young age are taught that everything they do in life is all to find a suitable man to marry and please. Girls are taught that men should be glorified and should be respected even when they (women) are being disrespected by men. From a young age girls are locked up like prizes to be won, restricted from doing simple things until one day they marry. But by then they don't know how to be self dependant, don't know that their life has much more than a man so they live their lives a slave to home. Sexism comes in many forms. Telling girls to not go outside after 6 pm, teaching men that it's acceptable for them to not respect women. Showing men that women are nothing but objects, girls being taught to only listen. And right now it is shown by telling women that they can't drink but men can.

Since Year 2007, NOCSL Annual Accounts are being audited by none other than the Auditor General and six final Audit reports with opinion for the period from 2007 \u2013 2012 already have been received. Despite having a few procedural lapses, NOCSL Annual accounts have been duly approved. The copies of such reports have already been submitted to the Ministry of Sports. The draft Annual accounts for the years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 are currently being examined by the Auditor General and final reports with opinion are expected shortly. On behalf of the Management of NOCSL, I have no hesitation whatsoever in assuring all those who are concerned about the accountability , transparency and good governance that NOCSL accounts are absolutely clear except for a few administrative and procedural errors. There is no meaning in discussing this subject prematurely, and I will be ready to answer all allegations levelled against the NOCSL accounts, when the final audit reports with Auditor General\u2019s opinion are available shortly. Besides, such audited accounts will be available for all members of the NOCSL no sooner NOCSL received them. Amidst all these vicious allegations against the NOCSL about fraudulent accounts, which are deliberately designed to confuse the general public and bring discredit to the current top management of the NOCSL, I have something very interesting to present. Mr. Rohan Fernando, who is the main critic of the NOCSL accounting systems has conveniently forgotten the fact that he headed the Finance and Management committee for six years since December, 2010. He has chaired all the finance committee meetings of the said committee. He was actively engaged in the above committee until 2017 and even claim that he is the Chairman of the de-facto Finance committee currently. Why is he only now talking about the fraudulent accounts of the NOCSL? What was he doing all these time in his capacity as the Chairman of the Finance Committee. The President NOCSL, Mr. Hemasiri Fernando in my opinion made a significant error by appointing Mr. Rohan Fernando as the Chairman of the Finance & Management committee in 2010 without carefully checking his qualifications and credentials.

With this document CHR/CaFFE attempts to demonstrate how the Prime Minister\u2019s actions violate the United Nations Convention Against Corruption.

Preventing women from consuming alcohol, selling alcohol and purchasing alcohol from liquor shops are restrictions put on ourselves. However, if such a law existed, this is an utter joke. Women who want to consume alcohol on various social levels, do so. The elite women consume alcohol in big hotels while the poor folk who engage in hard labour consume alcohol either at local taverns or liquor spots. This has been happening in a usual manner. All this time no one spoke against it. The Finance Minister too knew this when he issued the gazette notification to lift the ban. Therefore one wonders if this is just another method of trying to stir up society with regard to women consuming alcohol. I respect the Finance Minister and consider him a knowledgeable man on social issues. But before lifting such bans he must have been aware that there was such a rule. Our women did consume alcohol in the past, they still do and they will continue to do so even in the future. But by lifting this ban if anyone is of the view that women will start drinking and coming home drunk, then that is a wrong notion. But, our women today have taken on the burden of their families and they are aware of their responsibilities. A responsible woman knows where she has to go and just because the laws and relaxed women who love and care for their families will not start drinking and coming home drunk, shirking their responsibility. Just because they are allowed to drink if one thinks that society will be turned upside down, then they are very wrong. By now the monks have got worried about this issue, but there are much graver issues that these monks need to be focussing on. This issue has now been made political and everyone is trying to create a debate over this matter. Even some women who are debating this issue on political platforms and shouting about it, do consume alcohol on their own social classes. I feel that instead of these monks wasting their time over this petty issue, they should focus on the more grave social issues and just stick to preaching their doctrine. We should not take sides here.

That is notwithstanding the fact that women dominate the economy, and they control the three main means of foreign exchange earnings \u2013 as domestic servants in the Middle East and the tea and garment industries, it says. Removal of the ban on women from buying alcohol and being employed at liquor stalls is not a serious problem faced by women today. It is mostly men who criticized the removal of the ban, and the joint opposition too, strongly campaigned against it. Its MP Bandula Gunawardena has said women had never before gone to work at a bar, and challenged the president to use his executive powers to restore the ban. Also, Omalpe Sobhitha Thera said alcohol caused increases in vices, adding that it would be a myth to say that allowing women to work at bars will ensure their rights, adding that that would only negate the dignified status of women in society. Most of these opponents are of the view that the lifting of the ban will make women addicted to alcohol, thereby adversely affecting the family structure. On January 14, president Maithripala Sirisena said he would consider these views and re-impose the ban. The president\u2019s decision is not surprising, since he is on an anti-alcohol campaign. However, there are also opinions that the removal of the ban, done in consideration of equality for women, and its re-imposition show there are disagreements within the unity government. President Sirisena says the women\u2019s representation in election has been raised and that they are being encouraged to involve more in politics.

Today, I call upon all media institutions, the legal fraternity, private sector and civil society organizations, once again to unite with us in rendering all possible aid to the police in this investigation, by seeking out and volunteering relevant information, identifying and safeguarding possible witnesses and responding to any requests promptly and thoroughly, said the minister. The statement reads, Today, January 8th, 2018, marks the ninth anniversary of one of the most heinous crimes ever committed against Sri Lanka\u2019s constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression. It was nine years ago, today, at 10:45 AM that I received the news that Lasantha Wickrematunge, the fearless editor of The Sunday Leader, and my dear friend, had been ambushed and attacked as he drove to work. A few hours later when Lasantha succumbed to his injuries, Sri Lanka lost one of the most enigmatic and courageous journalists that the world had ever known. In the aftermath of this cowardly assassination, the media, legal fraternity, civil society and the political opposition parties joined together as one, demanding justice for Lasantha by way of a thorough and impartial investigation and condemning those who gave aid, comfort and shelter to his killers. For six years, we struggled in vain, until on January 8, 2015, the people of Sri Lanka threw out the Rajapakse regime and placed their faith in the Unity government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe. Our moral and civic duty to demand justice for Lasantha has been replaced with the responsibility for delivering that justice, by enabling and ensuring a thorough and impeccably independent police investigation, led by the officers of the Criminal Investigation Department. This investigation has already exposed the intricacy of the measures taken by the previous regime to cover up the murder. From the false cause-of-death in the original post-mortem report to the irregular transfer of the investigation away from the CID, and the death of a key witness-turned-suspect in custody, it is clear that no stone was left unturned. Despite these and whatever obstacles come before us, this government is committed to providing the CID and the Attorney General\u2019s Department with whatever resources and support they require to indict and convict those who committed, aided and instigated Lasantha\u2019s murder. Failure is unacceptable. This is a debt of honour that we owe not just to Lasantha and his family, but also to the citizens of Sri Lanka, who have been deprived of one of the foremost champions of their democracy.

May the Triple Gem Bless You First of all, I offer my best wishes for the New Year. As the people of the country are very eagerly waiting with high interest, I wish to make a statement on the final report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into the Bond Issuance of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, which was appointed by me taking into considerations the opinion of the people regarding allegations of corrupt practices and misdeed during the period 2015 and 2016. This report was handed over to me on December 30, 2017. The Commission was mandated to inquire into the period from 1st February 2015 to 31st March 2016 to find out actual facts and to make recommendation with regard to the steps to be implemented in the future. I thank the Supreme Court Judges and former Auditor General who functioned as members of the Commission and its Secretary and the staff, and those who assisted the work of the Commission, Attorney Generals Department, Police Department and other relevant organizations and individuals. The Commission is of the opinion that similar incidents as revealed in the Commission Report had happened even in 2008. The Commission recommends that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka should first conduct a forensic audit with regard to the alleged fraud and corrupt practices from 2008 and based on such findings legal steps should be taken. Commission states that funds of the Employment Provident Fund (EPF) were lost mostly during that period. The Commission has submitted a full report covering the period 2015 and 2016, comprising 1257 pages and it is not an interim report. The Commission has taken 10 months for this task. I have already submitted this report to the Attorney General and the Commission recommends that the criminal and civil court action must be taken through the Criminal Investigations Department and the Bribery or Corruption Commission. The Commission has clearly stated the structure of the Central Bank, Public Debt Department, direct issuance of bonds and the pros and cons of the system of bond issues and bond auctions. The report stated that the Perpetual Treasuries Limited has made profits through illegal means with the involvement of Mr Arjuna Mahendran, Bank officials and some outside individuals. In the auction held on 27th February 2015 alone the Perpetual Treasuries Limited has made a minimum benefit of over Rs 688 million. The Commission is of the opinion that further investigations could reveal that this amount could even be more than that. As revealed during the investigations Perpetual Treasuries Limited has made undue profit of Rs 11,145 millions in the secondary market. In this Employees Provident Fund and other government institutions had lost more than Rs 8,524 million or Rs 8.5 billion. It is stated that senior officials of the Central Bank were inactive before the former Governor of Central Bank, Arjuna Mahendran. It is believed that because they had not questioned about these and had become inactive, such incorrect decisions were made. Mr Mahendran has made interference into bond auctions through a system of incorrect and unconventional methods and he was responsible for providing internal information to outsiders. One party has used such information to obtain undue monetary profits. The Commission report said that the honorable Prime Minister\u2019s responsibility in the appointment of Mr. Arjuna Mahendren as the governor to the Central Bank was proper. The Commission is of the opinion that the Prime Minister made his statement in Parliament regarding the appointment of Mr Mahendran believing in the facts presented by Mr. Mahendran and Mr.Samarasiri, especially the promises made by Mr Mahendran. The Report also says that the Prime Minister should not have done that. The Commission stated that moreover these facts were before the COPE committee and the Prime Minister had not stated that because of that he had not taken the proper action against Mr. Mahendern. The Commission report refers to the allegation against former Finance Minister Mr Ravi Karunanayake regarding the payment of rent for the penthouse apartment belongs to the Aloysius Family and their Walt and Rowe Company and stated that Mr Karunanayake was responsible for that and recommended that the government should to take necessary action against Mr. Ravi Karunanayake under the section of bribery and corruption and further legal action under the penal codes for giving false evidence at the Commission. The Commission stated to the misuse of funds of the Employees Provident Fund and stated that EPF should be investigated under the forensic audit examination to find out the amount of losses. The repot has recognized that, the dishonesty of a particular party had lead to this kind of malpractice on EPF funds. The people responsible for these frauds have been identified and the Commission recommends legal action against them. The report recommends that, the legal action against relevant persons and officials who are responsible for the fraud including Perpetual Treasuries Limited, Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palihena should be taken. Accordingly, the government is in consultation with the legal authorities. Recommendation *Considering the recommendations of the Commission, the government recommends adapting a new Monetary Law Act in order to avoid this kind of malpractices in the Central Bank in future. The existing legal provisions are old and need replacement. *It is also recommended that the Registered Share Market Act must be replaced by a new legal act. *Members of Monetary Board and Central Bank Governor must be appointed by the Constitutional Council in concurrence of the members. The regulations must be amended accordingly. *The report recommends that there should be utmost supervision over the State Credit Department. As auditing at the Central Bank has not been conducted in a proper manner, the Commission recommended that the Audit Department must be reconstituted completely. A Legal Department must be established in the Central Bank and ensure that the Legal Department functions efficiently. *As the Commission did not have the mandate to inquire into treasury bond issues from 2008 to 2015, the Commission had not done that. However, Commission recommends that there should be an investigation into that period too. *The Commission recommends that the dealings with the Pan Asia Bank and the conduct of Chairman must be investigated unto. *The recommends that activities of the EPF must be looked into and in order to bring the ETF into a proper order, steps must be taken to restructure the ETF. *A code of conduct for the officials of the Central Bank must be introduced. The code of conduct for Primary Dealers must be revised and updated. *The Commission has stated that the Attorney General and the Bribery or Corruption Commission must take the legal actions to implement the recommendations of the Commission. *Under normal circumstances, recovery of money is done through civil legal action. However, it is a time consuming method. As an alternative, the Commission recommend that a Parliamentary Legislation could be passed and the money could be recovered in a speedy manner through a Parliamentary procedure. We agree to that recommendation. *The recommendation of te Commission is that all the expenditure occurred for the Commission must be recovered from the Perpetual Treasuries Limited. *I have already submitted a copy of the Commission Report to the Attorney General and he will identify the persons against who the legal action must be taken and initiate necessary criminal or civil legal action to implement the recommendations of the Commission. *I wish to clarify here, that a minor amendment to the Bribery or Corruption Commission Act must be enacted to take legal action on the recommendations of the Commission. For this purpose, already experts at the legal draughtsman are working on the required amendment. *The steps needed to make Bribery or Corruption Commission more active and efficient should have been done long time ago, and now we are taking required steps for that purpose. The confidentiality, astuteness and auditing methods of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka were extremely weak. There were no tele-recording systems, electronic monitoring or even CCTVs. The current Governor of the Central bank has already taken steps to remove weaknesses and rectify these errors. The Governor has informed that he has suspended some employees of the Central Bank after their malpractices were revealed in the investigations in the Commission and disciplinary actions are being taken against those officers. I expect the Governor to make a statement in the near future regarding the shortcomings in the Central bank as revealed in the Commission Report. I urge the Justice Ministry and the Attorney General to take early steps to draft the three bills proposed by the Commission present them to Parliament, in order to make required changes at the Central Bank to ensure such corrupt practices, frauds and malpractices would not take place in the future. I have informed my Secretary to hold monthly review meetings with the heads of relevant departments and institutions to examine the progress in implementations of the recommendations of the Commission to take legal steps against those individuals and take other required steps in an efficient and speedy manner. I would like to specifically state here that I would not hesitate to take steps to recover the loss of Rs 11,145 million and take legal action against the offenders and punish them. The sum of Rs 8529 million of the total losses Rs 11,145 million was the funds of the Employees Provident Fund, Mahapola Scholarship Fund, National Savings Bank and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation. The balance was from private institutions. Hence the loss to the public sector \u2013 EPF, Mahapola, NDB and SLIC was over Rs 8.5 billion. The Perpetual Treasuries Limited has made this profit of Rs 11,145 million within a short period of 5 months. Finally, especially I would like to mention that this final report must be presented to the Parliament and through this initiative the report must be open to the public. In the future, necessary as well as legal steps in this regard will be taken expeditiously according to the advice from the Attorney General. I kindly request to consider the openness of the facts of this Commission Report and I assure that any hesitation would not occur in filing cases against the offenders. Furthermore, I wish to state that this is the final report of the Commission. I have previously appointed a Commission and the report of that has been handed over to me. It is the final report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC). This Commission carried out their respective duties during the past two and half years. I extend my gratitude to the staff of the Commission and all the institutions including the Secretary and High Court judges for giving their support in this task. Already, 34 reports of that Commission had been handed over to me and recently 17 reports have been handed over and another 17 previously, the 17 reports handed over previously I have submitted to the Attorney General to take necessary actions through relevant institutions. By now, the Fraud and Corruption Commission, institutions, departments and Police have taken actions to file cases based on the facts of these reports. The report which was handed over to me before two days I will submit to Attorney General within this week to take appropriate actions. Especially I have to mention the actions on this report will be taken in the near future. The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges has presented several major facts and it is the responsibility of the Government to implement facts presented at the Commission. I will explain to you regarding those facts for the general public information. Training and appointment of suitable officials as there is lack for skilled well-trained officials to carry out investigation regarding fraud and corruptions. This Commission emphasized that people without required qualifications had been appointed and only the qualified persons should be appointed to essential positions including the State institutions, Authorities and Constitutional Boards. The Commission revealed that the money spent by the Government for the establishment of this Commission has already been recovered through the cases initiated through the findings of this Commission. A system must be implemented to hearing the cases in the courts in other areas as holding these cases only in Courts in Colombo is causing difficulties for those who travel from distances. I must states a special thing, before I conclude the facts of these two reports, I saw a great eagerness and inquiring trend among the general public regarding these Commissions. At the same time when the Commissions were appointed, especially before the appointment of the Bond Commission, some people commented, even in Parliament that nothing had happened to previous commissions and the same fate would happen to this commission too. They also said the intention of appointment of a commission was to cover up the wrong doings. But all of us must be very pleased regarding the fulfillment of duties of these Commissions and again I must thank the judges and all those who contributed in this regard for their great service rendered while wining the confidence of the general public. Finally, I must state regarding the allegations leveled against me by some political parties for appointing these Commissions. I never appointed these commissions targeting any political party. I must specially mention in future when the cases are filed in accordance with the investigations and the recommendations and information of these Commissions, individuals belongs to two main political parties will be among the defendants in the legal process. We must be happy over our independent and impartial Judiciary. I must state all of us will provide our maximum support for this process.

{"topic": "Elections, referendum and protests require active Tamil political participation", "date": "Jan 02, 2018", "full_news": "This article will look at three events expected to take place in the country in 2018 \u2013 local government elections in February, the adoption of a new constitution and protests by victims as they continue to demand the return of private land and for information about the disappeared \u2013 where participation will be vital if Tamils are to remain a viable factor in national politics. Local government elections have been announced for 10 February countrywide. Although local, they will be contested on national issues and large political questions. In the Sinhala-dominated South, it will be a referendum on the long-term viability of the incumbent national government. In the North and East, the results will show how far Tamils remain wedded to the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the largest Tamil party in parliament. The TNA also has an overwhelming majority in the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) and a significant number of seats in the Eastern Provincial Council. The main challenge to the TNA is from another collective of Tamil parties. The Eelam Peoples\u2019 Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) has broken away from the TNA to contest the election in a new alliance under the Tamil United Liberation Front\u2019s (TULF) party symbol. It is almost impossible that the new alliance will win a majority of seats in the local councils of the North and East. While it is yet to announce a programme of work and there are allegations that its constituent parties are working to New Delhi\u2019s wishes, its appeal lies in the party\u2019s leadership of TNA dissidents, while its platform denounces the TNA for compromising its electoral promises. The compromises are: ineffective accountability mechanisms for past human rights violations and an ineffectual political settlement through a new constitution, which goes against the party\u2019s election promises. Although the TULF is taking on the TNA at the forthcoming elections, it is important to note that other Tamil political formations in the recent past have displayed woeful political acumen. The Tamil People\u2019s Council (TPC) was formed under the leadership of NPC Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran, the EPRLF, the Tamil National People\u2019s Front (TNPF) and northern civil society organisations. However, other than holding very successful \u2018Eluga Thamil\u2019 rallies \u2013 one in Jaffna and another in Batticaloa \u2013 the TPC has done very little to rally behind important social and political causes of the day such as protests against military-held private land or the quest of families of the disappeared for truth and justice. There were also hiccups when the EPRLF split from the TNA and tried entering into an electoral alliance with TNPF which soon fell apart, before joining with the TULF. Why then should the Tamil people vote for such a party? There are at least three reasons. One: there is concern that multiple parties in the electoral arena will fragment the core set of Tamil demands. That is plain wrong. Obviously there were no united set of demands within the TNA; if not the EPRLF would not have split. Second, groups and individuals leaving established political parties representing the status quo is not necessarily political fragmentation. In this case at least, the TULF, in its new avatar, is hoping to plunge into active electoral politics. In other words the TNA will have a rival centre of power competing for votes, support and funds. And where democratic politics in North and East Sri Lanka is in right now, competition will be beneficial. Third, the February elections are for local councils. It will give the Tamil voters a chance to evaluate the capability of the new TULF before deciding to either support or ditch it at provincial or national elections. Tamils\u2019 political participation will also be of vital importance if the proposed new constitution sees the light of day. Although a new constitution being introduced depends primarily on the political calculations of the ruling coalition, it has been enthusiastically supported in this endeavour by the TNA. Two important documents have been drafted by parliamentary committees working with experts \u2013 the Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly of Sri Lanka and reports of six other sub-committees. Tamil commentators and interest groups reviewing these documents have said, the proposals are a gross violation of what the TNA told Tamil voters would form the elements of a political settlement. The Tamil Lawyers\u2019 Forum, an interest group said, \u201cHaving been elected \u2026 on the basis of campaigns which clearly stated that the North-East was the inseparable and indisputable homeland of the Tamils, the \u2026 TNA should not act against the people's mandate.\u201d The two reports are only proposals which the Constitutional Assembly, responsible for crafting the new constitution has the discretion to accept or not. According to laid out procedure, there will be no opportunities for the public to comment on the proposals before new constitution becomes basic law. Even if the public views compiled by the Report on Public Representations on Constitutional Reform are given due consideration, the fundamental question is: will the Constitutional Assembly dominated by Sinhala-Buddhist parliamentarians vote for a constitution for a federal, secular and ethnically neutral state? In other words, whether or not the TNA reaches a consensus with the government on constitutional proposals, as it has in the Interim Report, the fact is that the Sinhala-Buddhist majority\u2019s views will carry the Constitutional Assembly. If the new constitution passed by parliament does little to meet Tamils\u2019 aspirations, the TNA\u2019s messaging on it to the Tamil public will be of crucial importance. TNA\u2019s leader, also the Leader of the Opposition, R. Sampanthan, has stressed that following its adoption by parliament, the new constitution has to be ratified by the people at a referendum. While seemingly democratic and the instrument to forge a consensus in pluralistic Sri Lanka, realistically what chances do provisions favouring Tamils or Muslims stand in passing at a referendum where 70% of the ballots will be cast by Sinhala Buddhists? Assuming that the TNA votes for a constitution that only inadequately fulfils Tamil aspirations, where will this place the Tamils? A factor that has granted authenticity for Tamil opposition \u2013 both armed and nonviolent \u2013 has been the historic rejection by Tamil parties of both constitutions crafted in independent Sri Lanka. When the First Republican Constitution was being debated and the Constituent Assembly not only rejected the Tamil demand for federalism but even compromises for minimal power-sharing, the Federal Party withdrew in June 1971 and halted any further participation in the proceedings. When the Second Republican Constitution was adopted by the UNP government in 1978 and the TULF, then the largest Tamil party in the parliament did not participate because the then government refused accommodate its demands at the proposed round table conference. If the TNA agrees to vote with the government to signal reconciliation and goodwill, the only safeguard the Tamils will have to reject the new constitution and thereby continue to agitate for a freer, fairer and more equal state will be at a referendum. No doubt the numerical minority living in Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka will have minimal impact on a referendum that needs only 50% plus one vote to carry. But an important political statement will be made if a group that defines itself as a people and living in a territorially contiguous area rejects what becomes the basic law of the country. Finally, there are the public protests and civil disobedience campaigns carried out by the Tamil public to recover private land now occupied by the Sri Lanka military in Keppapilavu and Pilakudiyiruppu, and families of the disappeared for truth and justice for their missing loved ones. Protests erupted in early 2017 when victims finding both the Sri Lanka government and their elected representatives \u2013 TNA \u2013 unresponsive to their requests and resorted to direct action. Protests for land began on 31 January 2017 when landowners of Keppapilavu who had been promised by the military that their land would be returned were informed of a new delay. Inflamed that they were being double-crossed, the villagers pitched makeshift tents before a Sri Lanka Air Force camp and wowed not to return until they were allowed to resettle in their land. After almost a year of confrontation, the military has agreed to return 133 acres of the larger land it has occupied. The contours of the confrontation assumed many shapes and part of the settlement was the payment of at least Rupees 148 million to the military by the Ministry of Resettlement. Although at the time of writing there are still blocks for the families to resettle, it appears the remaining obstacles can be overcome. Although landowners have tried to cajole and humour the military into leaving Keppapilvu and other areas before, one important factor that turned the tide in this instance, was the constant presence of the victims and the relentless direct action they undertook. Similarly, families of the disappeared have been protesting in Kilinochchi and Mullaithivu from February asking for the information of their loved ones. Although their demands are yet to be met, their struggle has caught the eye of the international media and the international community. In his report on Sri Lanka at the UNHRC sessions in September this year UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zaid Hussein said \u201cIn the North, protests by victims indicate their growing frustration over the slow pace of reforms.\u201d Direct action by families of the disappeared was also able to force meetings with President Maithripala Sirisena in the past six months. Following the last meeting Kankaranjini Yogarasa a leader of the protests addressing the media said \u201cToday we lost faith that this government, which preaches Buddhist values, will give us back our children \u2026 but we will continue our unremitting struggle for our loved ones.\u201d As such, the families of the disappeared are campaigning for international intervention through the UN Human Rights Council pressing for the implementation of Resolution 30/1 and for an effective Office of Missing Persons and hybrid court with a robust international participation. In all three instances \u2013 putting together a viable opposition to the TNA at the local council elections, voting in a referendum if the new constitution is passed, and continuing protests for accountability and justice will need direct political participation of the Tamil people. It will most certainly meet opposition and possibly even violence, which nobody wishes for. But that is the path the current politics in North and East Sri Lanka is compelling the people to take.

This vote in favour of the resolution was on the basis of Sri Lanka\u2019s long held traditional and principled position, which is in keeping with the international understanding that Jerusalem is a final-status issue that must be resolved through negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both parties \u2013 Palestinians and Israelis, and that Jerusalem should be the shared capital of the Israeli and Palestinian States. The resolution adopted at the tenth emergency special session of the UN General Assembly on 21 December 2017 reaffirms this position, and Sri Lanka\u2019s vote in favour of the resolution was not a vote against any member State of the United Nations. Sri Lanka stands by its position that it is only by realizing the vision of two States living side-by-side in peace, security and mutual recognition, with Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Palestine, with all matters resolved permanently through negotiations, that the legitimate aspirations of both parties and sustainable peace can be achieved. Therefore, Sri Lanka strongly believes that all parties concerned should work with restraint, and focus on creating conditions for direct and meaningful negotiations that can resolve all final status issues required for a negotiated settlement. The BBC filed the following story titled \u2018Jerusalem: UN resolution rejects Trump's declaration: The UN General Assembly has decisively backed a resolution effectively calling on the US to withdraw its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The text says that any decisions regarding the status of the city are \"null and void\" and must be cancelled. The non-binding resolution was approved by 128 states, with 35 abstaining and nine others voting against. It came after US President Donald Trump threatened to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. Following the vote, state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the US was exploring \"various options\" and no decisions had yet been made. The nine who voted against the resolution were the US, Israel, Guatemala, Honduras, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau and Togo  Among the 35 abstaining were Canada and Mexico  Those voting in favour included the other four permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia and the UK) as well as key US allies in the Muslim world  There were 21 countries who did not turn up for the vote. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. Israel occupied the east of the city in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. The 193-member UN General Assembly held the rare emergency special session at the request of Arab and Muslim states, who condemned Mr Trump's decision to reverse decades of US policy earlier this month. The Palestinians called for the meeting after the US vetoed a Security Council resolution that was similar to the text approved on Thursday. The text put forward by Turkey and Yemen does not mention the US, but expresses \"deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem\". It also says \"any decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character, status or demographic composition of the Holy City of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded in compliance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council\". Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had promised to reject the results of the vote, calling the UN a \"house of lies\". Afterwards he said in a statement: \"Israel thanks President Trump for his unequivocal position in favour of Jerusalem and thanks those countries that voted alongside Israel, alongside the truth.\" A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the vote \"a victory for Palestine\". In a speech before the vote, US permanent representative Nikki Haley stressed that the US decision did not prejudge any final status issues, and did not preclude a two-state solution if the parties agreed to that. \"The United States will remember this day, on which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation,\" she said. \"America will put our embassy in Jerusalem. That is what the American people want us to do. And it is the right thing to do. No vote in the United Nations will make any difference on that.\" On Wednesday, Mr Trump warned he might cut financial aid to states who voted in favour of the resolution. \"They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars and then they vote against us,\" he said. \"Well, we're watching those votes,\" he added. \"Let them vote against us. We'll save a lot. We don't care.\" \u00a0", "intro": "Sri Lanka's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a statement in response to media queries on the Resolution on the \u2018Status of Jerusalem\u2019 adopted at the tenth emergency special session of the UN General Assembly on 21 December 2017.", "link": "https://srilankamirror.com/news/6374-sri-lanka-on-status-of-jerusalem-vote"},

Did the US embassy request his extradition from the Sri Lankan government after concealing his true identity? The issue is one of utmost seriousness while bringing into question the safety of Sri Lanka and power of diplomatic services within the country. Therefore it is important to further investigate the main issues believed to be related to this incident. While the information is not being made public for the benefit of any party, it is now being publicized in public interest as the country is now facing some unique challenges as a result of the current situation. A Russian Black Money Racketeer! Earlier this year newspapers reported the arrest of a Russian black money racketeer by the Weligama Police while it was later reported that he was released on bail. Identified according to reports as Fareen Manokin which claimed that he had escaped from the country a few days ago. While it can be assumed that the reported details had been sourced from the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) however many details remain vague including the time frame of events. Though the arrest was reported as have taken place in March it could even be several months later. However, the news of the Russian\u2019s arrest spread like wildfire through the diplomatic missions in Sri Lanka with some even pressurising the Sri Lankan government to hand over him to them. This arrest, in fact, caused unrest at the Russian Consulate and among other embassies as well. State-owned Daily News published a report on Saturday published the aim of the US embassy in this regard. Therefore, in this matter, it is necessary to understand the connection between the information presented and the possible relationship between them, which may be vague at times to investigate the current situation of the country. The man arrested in Weligama on a Friday is released the following Monday on bail with former Chairman of the Board of Investments Upul Jayasuriya and another senior officer representing him. However, attempts to elicit a response from Upul Jayasuriya in this regard failed. While gaining bail at the High Court, the man is able to avoid the courts and other government agencies in a systematic manner while taking refuge at a private hospital and a house for several weeks. Working under orders to keep a low profile till an escape is arranged he is said to have waited until the opportune moment. Meanwhile it is said finding out information regarding the man the US Embassy had requested him to handed over to them according to the extradition treaty between the two countries. Reliable sources say the US embassy had on several occasions requested for the man to be handed over to them as he is wanted for a large number of crimes committed on US soil. According to sources Head of the Russian Intelligence service Lieutenant General Igor Korobov is said to have a close relationship with Russian cyber criminals. The escaped criminal features in the FBI\u2019s most wanted list and sources say this had been conveyed to certain local officials. However, according to sources from the Sri Lanka Police, no such information was given and was only told that he was connected to several murders committed in the US. But additionally a fact revealed by US embassy could have been used to deduce the real identity of the suspect. That is this individual had worked towards disrupting the US Presidential election held in November 2016. However criminal investigation organizations in Sri Lanka and political leaders had not taken much notice of this piece of information. But it could also be that the embassy had failed to disclose all information about the individual while only revealing certain information about the person. If the person had, in fact, being involved in several murders in the US as claimed information regarding the person should be found on the internet. However, an internet search of the name mentioned in his passport only reveals information on how he was arrested in Sri Lanka and his eventual escape. That is only the information reported in the Daily News and similar information. This could only mean that the US embassy or the FBI had concealed information about the individual for reasons best known to them. If he is, in fact, a suspect and a computer expert who is said to have attempted to disrupt the US elections it is obvious that he is no common criminal. This is further proved by the US seeking for his extradition and the officers of the Russian Consulate directly trying to protect him. According to information revealed responsible persons in Sri Lanka were not aware of the real identity of this Russian national. The initial investigations had been conducted based on the information on his passport, law enforcement had strongly believed this information to be true. However if the officials had in fact obtained his fingerprints and other biological evidence for future use despite his escape should be commended. But as mentioned above it is clear that the individual was important due to the keen interest shown by the the US embassy and the FBI. Diplomatic and government sources allowing this individual to avoid the legal course of action while also allowing for him to escape has created a serious situation. How did this happen? Who are the stakeholders involved? What was the main reason for such interference? Are just some of the issues that have now surfaced due to this situation. According to one source a powerful political force have attempted to control the event following the Russian nationals arrest. Reliable sources claim that the former secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a Senior DIG attached to the CID was brought in to gain further information where they were later asked to \u2018avoid upsetting the Russians\u2019. Events take a different turn after this request with his escape is organized with the blessing of the state. While the US embassy in Colombo attempted to prevent this, all their efforts were to no avail. As a result he successfully escapes from the country with two possibilities for this escape now being presented by sources. According to one source the criminal had escaped by boat in the beginning of December while another claims he escaped through the airport under state protection. That is he had left in the private jet belonging to the owner of Rosoboronexport who visits the country which is the only agent for Russian state and security trade. If he had in fact escaped by boat questions arise as to how he was able to escape from the Sri Lanka Navy while sources also point out that to leave by private jet he would have had top political support from Sri Lanka. It is important to note that if he had left by the private jet belonging to one of the most powerful head of a leading armament company then he should be having top connections to the Russian government. However there are several important facts that one can arrive at about the person in terms of the already confirmed information as well as rumored sources. According to the top ten of the FBI's most wanted list currently there are four russian nationals identified as Alexei Belen, Dmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev, Igor Anatolyevich Sushchin and Evgeny Mikhailovich Bogachev. Lengthy details of these criminals can be found in FBI files. The man arrested in Weligama is said to be a black money launderer who is also suspected to be a Russian hacker involved in the US election hacking scandal. According to this information the man appears to closely resemble the character of Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev. If the man arrested was in fact Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev it is unsurprising that the US wanted him to be handed over with him being in the FBI most wanted list and having a bounty of USD 3 million on his head. According to sources the 34 year old Bogachev is a computer specialist who works unofficially for the Russian government. He is also known as a dangerous hacker who invented a virus enabling him to take control of over a million computers from all over the world. In 2011 the FBI began an investigation in to a virus named \u2018Zeus Trojan\u2019 or \u2018Game Over Trojan\u2019 and its effects as it affected over a million computers causing a financial loss of over USD 100 million. Computers, particularly in the western province in Sri Lanka was also found to be infected with the virus during the outbreak. Therefore if he was Bogachev the Russians have good reason to ensure his escape. The main reason for this is as he is considered a valuable asset as opposed to a liability. Meanwhile a popular website in Sri Lanka has published a photograph said to be of the man arrested. However it has been discovered that this photograph is fake and is originally from a website called 123rf.com which sells photographs. Therefore Sri Lanka is not in possession of any photographic proof of the person's identity and unofficial sources claim the proof in possession of our authorities have now disappeared. Visit this link to see the fake photograph being used. However it is also questionable if a person hiding out in a expensive private hospital would in fact escape in a boat. Wanted by the US: Who is the Russian Cyber Criminal that escaped from Sri Lanka? With a USD 3 million bounty set on his head by the FBI, did Russian cybercriminal Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev pose as one Farin Manokin? Did he escape by boat just months after being released on bail? Or did he flee in a private jet owned by the owner of Rosoboronexport? Who provided him security up to the Katunayake airport and dispatched him safely from Sri Lanka? Did the US embassy request his extradition from the Sri Lankan government after concealing his true identity?

However, the news of the Russian\u2019s arrest spread like wildfire through the diplomatic missions in Sri Lanka with some even pressurising the Sri Lankan government to hand over him to them. This arrest, in fact, caused unrest at the Russian Consulate and among other embassies as well. State-owned Daily News published a report on Saturday published the aim of the US embassy in this regard. Therefore, in this matter, it is necessary to understand the connection between the information presented and the possible relationship between them, which may be vague at times to investigate the current situation of the country. The man arrested in Weligama on a Friday is released the following Monday on bail with former Chairman of the Board of Investments Upul Jayasuriya and another senior officer representing him. However, attempts to elicit a response from Upul Jayasuriya in this regard failed. While gaining bail at the High Court, the man is able to avoid the courts and other government agencies in a systematic manner while taking refuge at a private hospital and a house for several weeks. Working under orders to keep a low profile till an escape is arranged he is said to have waited until the opportune moment. Meanwhile it is said finding out information regarding the man the US Embassy had requested him to handed over to them according to the extradition treaty between the two countries. Reliable sources say the US embassy had on several occasions requested for the man to be handed over to them as he is wanted for a large number of crimes committed on US soil. According to sources Head of the Russian Intelligence service Lieutenant General Igor Korobov is said to have a close relationship with Russian cyber criminals. The escaped criminal features in the FBI\u2019s most wanted list and sources say this had been conveyed to certain local officials. However, according to sources from the Sri Lanka Police, no such information was given and was only told that he was connected to several murders committed in the US. But additionally a fact revealed by US embassy could have been used to deduce the real identity of the suspect. That is this individual had worked towards disrupting the US Presidential election held in November 2016. However criminal investigation organizations in Sri Lanka and political leaders had not taken much notice of this piece of information. But it could also be that the embassy had failed to disclose all information about the individual while only revealing certain information about the person. If the person had, in fact, being involved in several murders in the US as claimed information regarding the person should be found on the internet. However, an internet search of the name mentioned in his passport only reveals information on how he was arrested in Sri Lanka and his eventual escape. That is only the information reported in the Daily News and similar information. This could only mean that the US embassy or the FBI had concealed information about the individual for reasons best known to them. If he is, in fact, a suspect and a computer expert who is said to have attempted to disrupt the US elections it is obvious that he is no common criminal. This is further proved by the US seeking for his extradition and the officers of the Russian Consulate directly trying to protect him. According to information revealed responsible persons in Sri Lanka were not aware of the real identity of this Russian national. The initial investigations had been conducted based on the information on his passport, law enforcement had strongly believed this information to be true. However if the officials had in fact obtained his fingerprints and other biological evidence for future use despite his escape should be commended. But as mentioned above it is clear that the individual was important due to the keen interest shown by the the US embassy and the FBI. Diplomatic and government sources allowing this individual to avoid the legal course of action while also allowing for him to escape has created a serious situation. How did this happen? Who are the stakeholders involved? What was the main reason for such interference? Are just some of the issues that have now surfaced due to this situation. According to one source a powerful political force have attempted to control the event following the Russian nationals arrest. Reliable sources claim that the former secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a Senior DIG attached to the CID was brought in to gain further information where they were later asked to \u2018avoid upsetting the Russians\u2019. 4Events take a different turn after this request with his escape is organized with the blessing of the state. While the US embassy in Colombo attempted to prevent this, all their efforts were to no avail. As a result he successfully escapes from the country with two possibilities for this escape now being presented by sources. According to one source the criminal had escaped by boat in the beginning of December while another claims he escaped through the airport under state protection. That is he had left in the private jet belonging to the owner of Rosoboronexport who visits the country which is the only agent for Russian state and security trade. If he had in fact escaped by boat questions arise as to how he was able to escape from the Sri Lanka Navy while sources also point out that to leave by private jet he would have had top political support from Sri Lanka. It is important to note that if he had left by the private jet belonging to one of the most powerful head of a leading armament company then he should be having top connections to the Russian government. However there are several important facts that one can arrive at about the person in terms of the already confirmed information as well as rumored sources. According to the top ten of the FBI's most wanted list currently there are four russian nationals identified as Alexei Belen, Dmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev, Igor Anatolyevich Sushchin and Evgeny Mikhailovich Bogachev. Lengthy details of these criminals can be found in FBI files. The man arrested in Weligama is said to be a black money launderer who is also suspected to be a Russian hacker involved in the US election hacking scandal. According to this information the man appears to closely resemble the character of Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev. If the man arrested was in fact Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev it is unsurprising that the US wanted him to be handed over with him being in the FBI most wanted list and having a bounty of USD 3 million on his head. According to sources the 34 year old Bogachev is a computer specialist who works unofficially for the Russian government. He is also known as a dangerous hacker who invented a virus enabling him to take control of over a million computers from all over the world. In 2011 the FBI began an investigation in to a virus named \u2018Zeus Trojan\u2019 or \u2018Game Over Trojan\u2019 and its effects as it affected over a million computers causing a financial loss of over USD 100 million. Computers, particularly in the western province in Sri Lanka was also found to be infected with the virus during the outbreak. Therefore if he was Bogachev the Russians have good reason to ensure his escape. The main reason for this is as he is considered a valuable asset as opposed to a liability. Meanwhile a popular website in Sri Lanka has published a photograph said to be of the man arrested. However it has been discovered that this photograph is fake and is originally from a website called 123rf.com which sells photographs. Therefore Sri Lanka is not in possession of any photographic proof of the person's identity and unofficial sources claim the proof in possession of our authorities have now disappeared. Visit this link to see the fake photograph being used. However it is also questionable if a person hiding out in a expensive private hospital would in fact escape by boat. Therefore it is unsurprising if he had escaped by the private jet of Rosoboronexport. 2In recent times there has been much political discussion regarding the Rosoboronexport company and the Russian government funding Sri Lanka has received through them while media has also pointed out its links to a private media organizations parent company in the recent past. However according to sources there is currently no proof to say he escaped via the Airport as being alleged. And that he was handed over to Russia due to his nationality they said adding that the news of his escape is a concocted lie. However this situation also goes on to prove that Sri Lanka is now trapped between the Diplomatic tussles of other powerful countries and should focus on how they approach the issue as it is very important that correct decisions are taken to protect the country and its future security.

Russian authorities have assured that their asbestos products were not harmful to health in any way and promised to take Sri Lankan experts to the factories to help them gain a firsthand experience, said the ambassador. Russia imposed a ban on Sri Lanka tea and agricultural products imports, effective from December 18. Ambassador during the Rajapaksa regime Udayanga Weeratunga has claimed in a statement that it was an act of retaliation to Sri Lanka\u2019s ban on the use of asbestos. Sri Lanka mainly imports asbestos from Russia. That country\u2019s ambassador in Colombo has intimated to the Sri Lankan government about his displeasure over the ban, saying it was imposed on an unacceptable reason. However, incumbent ambassador Weerasinghe refuted the claim by his predecessor Weeratunga, and stressed the bans on asbestos and tea were unrelated. He expressed confidence that the matter could be resolved quickly.

The Group issued its preliminary findings yesterday (15). However, the committee positively accepted certain steps taken by Sri Lanka. The Working Group also commended the constructive cooperation of the Government of Sri Lanka with the international community, in particular the United Nations Human Rights Mechanisms. The visit of the Working Group and the recent visits of other UN Special Procedures are a clear example of such engagement. However, the experts recognize positive initiatives, including engagement with UN human rights mechanisms, as well as the recent accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. \u201cThe right to personal liberty has yet to be respected by law enforcement, security forces, judicial and other authorities,\u201d the experts said it their statement. They said that current powers to deprive individuals of their liberty extended across a range of facilities, including police stations, prisons, open work camps, centres for juveniles and the elderly, mental health institutions and rehabilitation camps for former combatants, as well as those for drug addicts and people in vulnerable situations. The experts called for urgent reforms to address problems including the excessive use of remand, a lack of effective alternatives to detention, an outdated legal framework and reliance on confessions, often extracted under torture or duress. Court proceedings were affected by excessive and unjustified delays, while suspects remained in detention indefinitely, they said, adding that the rights to the presumption of innocence and due process were yet to be fully recognized.  The experts noted the need for the abolition of the special laws and powers enacted during the state of emergency. The Working Group urged the Government of Sri Lanka to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1979, which is a primary mechanism that enables arbitrary detention for over four decades. Any new legislation must be in accordance with international human rights law and best practices.

The man, whom the Guardian has chosen to refer to as Jyran, was told on 6 December by the department of immigration to prepare to be deported imminently from Australia. Jyran faces arrest in Sri Lanka over his alleged links to the defeated separatist army the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam \u2013 the Tamil Tigers. He is not alleged to have been a fighter: his arrest warrant states he faces charges of \u201cassisting anti-government activities and supporting and assisting a terrorist organisation\u201d. The Tamil Tigers were ultimately defeated in 2009 after 26 years of brutal civil war. The asylum seeker, an ethnic Tamil, went through Australia\u2019s controversial \u201cfast-track\u201d refugee status determination process and was found to not meet the criteria for refugee status. Under the fast-track system, no additional information can be brought after an initial protection application. Jyran did not present the arrest warrant in the first instance, later explaining he did not understand the Australian justice system and feared he would   because of it. Having failed to produce the warrant, his protection claim was dismissed as not credible, and the Immigration Assessment Authority, which reviewed his case, chose not to consider the document after being presented with it. But the UN committee heard that Jyran faced \u201cstate-sanctioned torture\u201d if he were to be refouled.  Jyran\u2019s lawyer, Alison Battisson, told the committee. There has been widespread reportage of the mistreatment and torture of prisoners by Sri Lankan security forces, including the systematic use of rape. In July this year the UN\u2019s special rapporteur Ben Emmerson visited Sri Lanka and reported that \u201cthe use of torture, has been, and remains today, endemic and routine, for those arrested and detained on national security grounds\u201d.  Emmerson wrote. Arrest warrants over alleged links to the Tamil Tigers are often seen as highly politicised or based on limited, or no, evidence. Battisson, the director of Human Rights for All, said the committee\u2019s interim measure highlighted the serious issues faced by Tamil asylum seekers facing forcible return from Australia. \u201d Battisson said she was relieved the committee against torture had chosen to act, and quickly, to prevent the potential refoulement of Jyran. \u201cThese interim measures are quite rare \u2013 this illustrates the very real concern the UN has over Australia\u2019s practices of refouling Tamils to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is not safe for many Tamils to return to.\u201d A spokesperson from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection told the Guardian that people with no lawful basis to remain in Australia were expected to return home. \u201cAustralia does not remove people to Sri Lanka who engage Australia\u2019s non\u2011refoulement obligations.

There is not even a verbal contract. Therefore, there is no undertaking to pay back the funds,\u201d Dayaratne said. The Senior Deputy Solicitor General requested to vacate the Interim Order challenging the maintainability of the of the writ petition. He said former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was challenging a document which had been filed two years ago. \u2018The certificate issued by an ASP in terms of Public Property Act has been filed two years ago (2015). The undue delay is a ground to refuse this application. This is an application,the court should not entertain due to the delay. There has been no violation of law either on the part of the Attorney General or FCID,\u2019 he further added. Senior Deputy Solicitor General further said that the D.A.Rajapaksa Foundation voluntarily agreed to pay Rs.33 million in August, 2015, after the police commenced their investigations in May 2015. He further said investigations also revealed that the D.A. Rajapaksa Foundation is not a Statutory Board. President\u2019s Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for the former Defence Secretary stated that there is no criminal aspect to this case. \u2018There was a civil contract from the beginning to the end. There is no wrongful act committed by Rajapaksa. There is no criminality in this case,\u2019 de Silva added. Finally he sought Court jurisdiction to extend the Interim Order until the next inquiry date. Further inquiry was fixed for January 25. The Court of Appeal (CA) yesterday further extended until January 25, its Interim Order preventing police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act regarding a Magistrate\u2019s Court inquiry. The CA extended this Interim Order preventing police from acting under the Public Property Act against Rajapaksa, on the Galle Magistrate\u2019s Court inquiry over a complaint that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million. On November 29, the Interim Order was issued on the basis of an ex parte proceeding by a two-judge-bench comprising Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne. This is pursuant to a writ petition filed by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. The Court upheld Rajapaksa\u2019s version that the certificate issued under section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violative of his legitimate expectations. Rajapaksa cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director Shani Abeysekara, FCID Director Ravi Waidyalankara and the Attorney General as respondents. Rajapaksa also seeks an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition preventing the respondents from proceeding or relying upon the certificate filed under and in terms of section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act against him. Rajapaksa maintained that the offences against the Public Property Act contains a provision in section 8(1) as amended where, upon the certification by a Police Officer that the value of the matter exceeds Rs. 25,000, it will not be competent for the magistrate\u2019s court unless in exceptional circumstances to release such a person on bail after recording reasons. Rajapaksa stated that one such method was to say that there was a criminal offence committed by Rajapaksa regarding monies belonging to the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Board (SLLRDC). Rajapaksa stated that recently he was informed that he is to be arrested. He further said that originally the proceedings reflect a possible charge of money laundering. He stated that there is no offence whatever in respect of the said matter. He states that the D.A Rajapaksa Foundation, a statutory body, entered into a contract with the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Department for the construction of a monument at Medamulana in Weeraketiya. Rajapaksa states that there was no written contract. He stated that, at all times the petitioner, the Foundation and SLLRDC acted on the basis that there was a contract between the SLLRDC and the foundation and that the foundation would pay to the SLLRDC lawfully due for the construction of the monument. He states that the monument was unveiled on or about November 6, 2014 though not complete, because that was the death anniversary of the late D.A. Rajapakse. The petitioner states that the government changed in January 2015 and the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Board came under the Megalopolis Ministry, under Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka. In August of 2015, the Foundation received a request for a part payment which the Foundation paid. The petitioner pleads that thereafter he received a letter of demand.

Your courage and sincerity continue to help those who are most in need in our society. As a Sri Lankan, this is a proud moment for me as well to see your work recognised. You have touched the lives of so many, and what you have done, and continue to do, stands not only as a contribution to the citizens of Sri Lanka, but to all of humanity.

When we asked her what the reason was for this situation, she said the Maha Sangha in country states that there is no Bikkhuni order in the country and is opposed to them receiving Identity Cards or Passports under the title \u2018Meheni\u2019 or a title that identifies their status. Therefore, the \u201cSanghamith Diyani Foundation\u201d charged that this situation has arisen as a result of the male dominancy within the Buddha Sasana and their male counterpart acting in a selfish and jealous manner to obtain status and benefits just for themselves. The foundation alleges that at an earlier instance, when this issue was raised at the Buddha Sasana Ministry, the Monks had manipulated the department officials and obstructed justice being served to the Bikkhuni order. However. Prior to 2004, IDs for Bikkhuni\u2019s were issued without any hassle but it was refused for the ordained female monks. During that period the ID referred to them as \u2018Bikshuni\u2019 but it was later changed to \u2018Sil Matha\u2019.

Therefore, she urged the relevant authorities to take appropriate measures to rectify this issue and grant the rightful status to the Bikkhuni order.
